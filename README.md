# Article-Summary-Extraction-NLP
Given an article, generate its summary
In NLP, there are two approaches to do the text summarization. 
The first one, extractive approach, is a simple approach which is extracting key words or sentences from article. 
The second one, abstractive approach, is generating a new sentences base on given article. It needs more advanced technique.
The approach used here is the extractive one.

## TO RUN : 
a. without API : execute summarizer.py

b. with API : execute summarizer_api.py
