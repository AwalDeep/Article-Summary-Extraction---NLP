Thakur reached the Bhawani Mata Temple at Peer Gate in Bhopal in the morning and after performing aarti, sang bhajans (devotional songs) in the presence of the BJP leaders. She then proceeded to the Gufa Mandir at Lal Ghati and also to a nearby gaushala (cow shelter), where she offered fodder to the cows and calves. Thakur appeared to be following in the steps of Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who too spent time temple hopping following a 72-hour ban for his ""Ali-versus-Bajrang Bali"" remark last month. The EC ban followed complaints against Thakur for her offensive remark against 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks martyr Hemant Karkare and her boast that she had participated in the demolition of the Babri Masjid on December 6, 1992. While imposing the ban on her, the Commission had strongly condemned her remarks and warned her not to repeat the ""misconduct"". The EC had said though Thakur had apologised for her statement against the IPS officer, it found the statement to be unwarranted. Pragya Thakur, an accused in the Malegaon blast case of September 2008, got herself embroiled in a series of controversies after being declared BJP's candidate from Bhopal Lok Sabha constituency. Her comment that former Maharashtra ATS chief Hemant Karkare was killed due to her curse, as he had tortured her in custody evoked sharp reactions. Thakur is pitted against Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh in Bhopal, where polling will be held on May 12.

Of course, Chhattisgarh has single-handedly contributed to this rise, having clocked 247 surrenders by October-end, up from just 28 in 2013.  Incidentally, Chhattisgarh has also reported a major increase in the number of Maoists arrested this year. According to data shared by the Union home ministry in reply to a question in the Lok Sabha on Tuesday, arrests in the state grew from 387 in 2013 to 517 until October 15 this year.  However, the nearly nine-fold rise in surrenders as well as notable rise in arrests is essentially limited to Chhattisgarh. Surrenders in Andhra Pradesh were 76 until October 31 against 82 for whole of last year. Bihar reported 150 Left wing extremism-related incidents and arrested 329 Maoists (until November 15) but managed just 4 surrenders until October 31.  Jharkhand recorded the highest number of incidents at 318, highest number of civilian killings at 77, while Maoists killed were 8 and arrested, 364. The surrenders were a measly 17, almost at the same level of 15 recorded last year.  Odisha has shown incidents at around the same level (97 until November 15 against 101 last year), but surrenders are down at 80 as on October 31 (from 101 in 2013) and Maoists arrests at just half (67) of the 2013 levels (129).  A special session on police response in rural areas of Left-wing extremism-hit states will be conducted during the DGP/IGP meet slated to be held on November 29 and 30 in Guwahati.

This came on the back of continued buying by participants amid a mixed trend in global markets after the US Fed kept its near-zero benchmark interest rate unchanged.  Besides, strengthening of the rupee by 25 paise at 63.87 against the dollar in early trade supported the rally.  The 30-share index surged 200.65 points, or 0.75 per cent, to trade above the 27,000 level at 27,033.31, with all sectoral indices led by healthcare, oil & gas, capital goods and consumer durables trading in the positive zone with gains of up to 1.04 per cent.  The gauge had gained 461.68 points in the past four straight sessions.  Also, the NSE index Nifty gained back the 8,100 mark by surging 45.75 points, or 0.57 per cent, at 8,137.30.  Brokers said a mixed trend in Asian markets, tracking overnight gains in US bourses after the US Fed kept its near-zero benchmark interest rate unchanged and Chairman Janet Yellen pledged a methodical approach to rate increase, influenced sentiment here.  Furthermore, above-normal monsoon so far and narrowing of the country's trade deficit perked up mood, they said.  Prominent gainers that supported the key indices were Cipla, RIL, ICICI Bank, Wipro and Axis Bank.  Among other Asian markets, Hong Kong's Hang Seng was up 0.12 per cent while Japan's Nikkei shed 0.60 per cent in early trade on Thursday.

The proposed amendments seek to deter the prospective violators from vandalizing and destroying public/private property during agitations and other forms of protests. The proposed amendments will also deter the office-bearers of these organizations.  The Supreme Court had set up a committee under the chairmanship of Justice KT Thomas, former Judge of the Supreme Court, to examine modalities to be adopted to make the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 (PDPP Act, 1984) more effective and also suggest suitable changes, which could make the Statute more meaningful.  The committee concluded that the present law was inadequate and ineffective to deal with the increasing number of instances of public property damage and made some recommendations for amendment in the Prevention of Damage to Public Properties Act, 1984. MHA had decided to accept the recommendations of the Justice KT Thomas Committee.  The present provision of the Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act, 1984 and the proposed draft Prevention of Damage to Public Property Act are also available on the ministry of Home Affairs website www.mha.nic.in.  The suggestions/comments on the proposed draft PDPP Act (Amendment) Bill, 2015 from the Public and other stakeholders are solicited on or before 20th July 2015 and the same may be sent to the ministry of Home Affairs, CS Division, 5th Floor, NDCC Building, Jai Singh Road, New Delhi-110001.

The action comes after Saudi aviation authorities made this damning finding public following a probe into the incident which had happened at 00:03 hours local time Riyadh. The Jet Airways Boeing 737 went off the paved area of Riyadh airport last Friday (August 3) when it   attempted to take off using full power from a taxiway   parallel to the runway from where it was supposed to get air borne for Mumbai. “Jet Airways B-737 (VT-JFS) flight (9W) 523 headed to Mumbai with 141 passengers and seven crew members overshot taxiway at KKIA (King Khalid International Airport at Riyadh). Initial factual information confirms that the aircraft attempted take off from taxiway parallel to take off-designated runway while visibility was high and no obstacles or FOD (foreign object debris) on the taxiway. The aircraft accelerated with full take off power and exceeded the taxiway on to unpaved area ending up close to the exit of taxiway,” Saudi Arabia’s Aviation Investigation Bureau (AIB) said in a statement. A senior official of Indian DGCA said it has suspended license of both the pilots involved in runway excursion incident at Riyadh pending investigation. “The fire and rescue teams were at the site immediately, all passengers and crew were evacuated through the aircraft emergency slides with no injuries. The AIB is conducting a safety investigation into the event with participation of the Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau of India,” it added. Following Saudi probe report, Jet on Monday said the airline is ""in contact with the DGCA and has extended all co-operation with regard to the said incident. The airline will continue to adhere to all requirements as laid down by the regulator. The matter is currently under investigation and we cannot comment on this issue. At Jet Airways safety is of paramount importance of its crew and guests."" Jet had last Friday said that the incident happened when their plane was trying to take off from the runway. “Our flight 9W 523 with 142 guests and 7 crew members from Riyadh to Mumbai of 3rd August aborted takeoff and departed the runway at Riyadh Airport. All our guests and crew have been evacuated safely with no reported injuries,” the airline had said. But the preliminary probe by Saudi authorities has found that the lane was trying to take off from a taxiway parallel to the take off-designated runway at full power.

Among the 14 measures ordered by the green court on Wednesday was a ban on petrol and diesel vehicles older than 15 years — a move that’s likely to take an estimated 10 lakh vehicles off the road. It also barred burning of waste in the open besides placing restrictions on parking and ordering stricter vigil on overloaded trucks entering the city.  NGT, which has the powers of a civil court, sought immediate steps for building cycle tracks in the city and asked authorities to probe the possibility of installing air purifiers at marketplaces. READ ALSO: Jittery owners say they maintain vehicles well The order was issued by a bench headed by NGT chairperson Swatanter Kumar, with expert members D K Agarwal and A R Yousuf, in response to a petition filed early this year on Delhi’s air pollution by Vardhaman Kaushik.  “An article published in the Times of India today has been brought to the notice of the tribunal. It not only projects a very dismal state of affairs … with clear indication that worst is likely to follow,” the bench said.  NGT said petrol and diesel vehicles more than 15 years old shall not be permitted to on Delhi roads. These vehicles are to be seized by authorities as per the Motor Vehicle (MV) Act. READ ALSO: Auto industry pushes for scrapping old vehicles It also ordered that the RTO shall not renew or issue registration for such vehicles or provide fitness certificates. If any such old vehicle is parked in a public area, it would towed away and challaned, the tribunal said.  “It is undisputed…that the air pollution of NCT, Delhi is getting worse with each passing day,” it stated. READ ALSO: Burning of leaves — agencies pass buck Referring to air pollution peaking in the morning hours, as reported by TOI, the order said, “This article declares that it may not be safe for residents of Delhi to go out for morning walks due to heavy pollutants present in the air.”  TOI’s report on Wednesday had displayed data from the System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology and Delhi Pollution Control Committee, which showed PM2.5 (fine pollution particles) peaking early in the morning, creating a health risk for those who exercise outdoors. Those exposed to air in the evenings are equally at risk of developing respiratory illnesses and complications, the data suggests. READ ALSO: Traffic cops to help pumps enforce PUC-for-fuel rule Delhi’s air pollution levels are comparable with Beijing which has started implementing radical measures such as shutting industries during high pollution days, putting a cap on vehicles on the road and keeping schools closed on bad air quality days.  The NGT bench went a step ahead and ordered that any person will have the right to approach the tribunal, police or DPCC to complain about open burning of plastics, leaves and other materials which can result in air pollution. It directed DPCC and Delhi government to create a web portal where the public can upload pictures of any such violations. A “special force” constituted by the government will enforce the direction and ensure compliance. READ ALSO: Enforcement needed now for results, say activists The bench said no parking shall be allowed on tarred roads meant for regular traffic movement. “The chairperson was concerned about how Delhiites are going to cope in the high air pollution season that will last for the next six months. He was stern about immediate action on air pollution and gave the example of Lajpat Nagar, where it can take up to 40 minutes for motorists to reach the market from the main road due to congestion. He directed that parking be allowed only on one side of such roads near market areas,” said Narender Pal Singh, advocate representing Delhi government.  The bench also directed that cycle tracks be constructed in most parts of the city immediately. DPCC was asked to examine the possibility of installing air purifiers in all markets, crowded places and areas where traffic was heavy.  “We make it clear that in the event of any officer or person found violating these directions or not complying with them, we will be compelled to take coercive steps and pass such orders as may be required in accordance with law,” the order stated.

Most of these constituencies are within 100km from the Bengal border, while two others are fighting from Commila, located close to Tripura border and two Jamaat-Ul Mujahideen Bangaladesh (JMB) leaders are from Shyllet, which is adjoining Assam and is now plagued with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) issue. Sources said that the maximum concentration of the Jamaat leaders are found within a range of 50-100km from the Bengal border. The son of a top JMB leader Delwar Hossain Sayeedi, who is now serving life term as a war criminal, is contesting from Pirojpur which is barely 160km from Kolkata. Thus, the reason behind fielding JMB candidates close to the Bengal border is considered significant by India. The Bangladesh government has already informed Delhi that there are support groups for JMB in Bengal and they are helping in cattle smuggling and running arms racket and involved gold smuggling. Some local political leaders in the border areas of Bengal are helping people associated with the JMB in lieu of money, according to the reports sent by Dhaka. It is already proven that JMB has bases in Bengal and adjoining states as several of its activists were arrested after the Khagragarh blast in Burdwan in October 2014. NIA in its chargesheet in the Khagragarh blast case had mentioned that JMB men carried out subversive activities in Bengal and were collecting funds and recruiting youths into the fold of JMB and were training them to wage war in a neighbouring country. Even Dhaka has sent a dossier to Delhi about JMB and how it is increasing its presence in Bengal as many of them have taken shelter in Bengal. Moreover, there are hints that the JMB might try to create violence during the polls in Bangladesh. For which security along the border is going to be tightened, so JMB leaders or their support group do not manage to sneak in after creating violence. However, officially the spokesman of the Indian foreign office Raveesh Kumar has described the election in Bangladesh to be an internal matter of Bangladesh. As an Islamic terror group, JMB has been banned from contesting the polls by the Bangladesh election commission. For which many of them are contesting as independent candidates or on BNP symbol. The JMB is now having a seat adjustment with BNP. Initially there were talks for 45 seats in favour of JMB candidates, now 25 of them are going to contest on BNP symbol, according to inputs sent to Delhi. So Indian agencies are keeping track on the constituencies from which the JMB leaders are contesting as most of them are on the border except one in Dhaka.

This is the first time Fadnavis has come under attack from NCP which has supported his minority government.  NCP spokesman Nawab Malik said for the last six years since the attacks Fadnavis had taken the lead in targeting the then state government over the issue and had derived political mileage.  ""But after coming to power, he has conveniently forgotten the martyrs and stayed away from paying homage at the memorial in Mumbai. The excuse being given is he is with the President of India who is on tour of the state. But previous chief ministers, on such occasions, would send ministers in charge of protocol to the President's function,"" Malik said.  Malik alleged that Fadnavis had no sympathy for for the martyrs.  Meanwhile, state unit NCP president Sunil Tatkare visited the memorial of 26/11 martyrs here and paid homage.  Similarly, the state Congress also organised a function to mark the sixth anniversary of the terror attacks and observed a two-minute silence as a mark of respect for the martyrs.

The flag sports the images of Congress icons K Kamaraj and G K Moopanar.  “It is a significant milestone. We are confident that this flag will fly very high in Tamil Nadu,” Vasan said, evoking loud applause from his supporters in a community hall here.  The saffron on the flag signified sacrifice while white and green represented peace and prosperity, he said.  Vasan quit the Congress along with senior functionaries and elected representatives on November 3, after a controversy erupted over the images of the Congress leaders in the membership cards.  “I am sure, today’s event will assure the revival of great leaders -- Kamaraj’s rule in Tamil Nadu and Moopanar’s prosperous Tamil Nadu and strong India,” he said, reiterating that his party would strive hard to take to the public the facets of Kamaraj’s rule – clean and transparent governance.  Vasan moved the Election Commission last week to revive his father Moopanar’s Tamil Maanila Congress. However, the party’s name will officially be made known in a rally to be held in Trichy on Friday.  With the state awaiting assembly polls in 2016, Vasan said the question of alliance with the DMK and the AIADMK did not arise now. “Especially with the BJP, it does not arise. We have different paths,” he said.  When prodded, the former Union minister said the electoral alliances could be decided only at the time of elections.  “I really believe and work to be the first party in Tamil Nadu before elections,” he said, declaring majority of the Congress cadres were with him in all districts.

(Photo: nasa.gov)An artist’s ren...Read MoreWASHINGTON: Scientists are developing a predictive model to help Nasa anticipate conflicts and communication breakdowns among crew members and head off problems that could make or break the US space agency's future manned mission to Mars. Nasa has formalised plans to send a crewed spacecraft to Mars, a journey that could involve 250 million miles of travel, said researchers from the Northwestern University in the US. In a multi-phase study, scientists are studying the behaviour of analogue astronaut crews on mock missions, complete with isolation, sleep deprivation, specially designed tasks and mission control, which mimics real space travel with delayed communication. The goal is to establish the effects of isolation and confinement on team functioning, to identify methods to improve team performance, to develop a predictive model that Nasa could use to assemble the ideal team and identify potential issues with already composed teams before and during the mission. Even for an astronaut, the psychological demands of this Mars journey will be exceptional. The spacecraft will be small, roughly the size of a studio apartment, and the round-trip journey will take almost three years. ""Astronauts are super humans. They are people who are incredibly physically fit and extremely smart,"" said Leslie DeChurch, a professor at Northwestern University. ""We are taking an already state-of-the-art crew selection system and making it even better by finding the values, traits and other characteristics that will allow Nasa to compose crews that will get along,"" DeChurch said. Communication delays with worldwide mission controls will exceed the 20-minute mark. In that sense, the Mars mission will be like no mission that has come before. ""A lot of the past efforts to try to create models to simulate the future have run into criticism because people have said it's not really grounded in good data,"" said Noshir Contractor, a professor at Northwestern University. ""What we have here is unprecedented good data. We are not talking about intuition and expert views, this model is based on real data,"" Contractor said. The researchers have been culling data from the Human Experimentation Research Analog (HERA) at Houston's Johnson Space Center. HERA's capsule simulator houses astronauts for up to 45 days; a mock mission control outside the capsule augments the realism with sound effects, vibrations and communication delays. Those on the inside undergo sleep deprivation and try to perform tasks. The researchers collect moment-to-moment metrics about individual performance, moods, psychosocial adaptation and more. The teams have studied experienced diminished abilities to think creatively and to solve problems, according to results from the first eight analogue space crews, and are able to successfully complete tasks between 20 and 60 per cent of the time. ""Creative thinking and problem solving are the very things that are really going to matter on a Mars mission. We need the crew to be getting the right answer 100 per cent of the time,"" DeChurch said. The researchers are also expanding the experiment to the SIRIUS analogue in Moscow, where, beginning on March 15, four Russians and two Americans, will undertake a 120-day fictional mission around the Moon, and including a lunar landing operation.

The buzz that was going on for quite some time intensified after a series of meetings between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP National President JP Nadda in the national capital.  Sources stated Nadda had been frequently visiting the Prime Minister's residence for a month now. According to sources it is likely that four ministers could be inducted from Bihar.  The sources told ANI that among the four likely to be included in the cabinet -- two are from Janata Dal (United), one from Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) fraction group Pashupati Paras, and one from Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).  Earlier sources in the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) stated that the party is likely to accommodate a few of its prominent leaders and National Democratic Alliance (NDA) members in the Narendra Modi Cabinet soon. It has been two years since the NDA came back to power in 2019.  There are also speculations of several senior leaders like former Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal and senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia to be accommodated. Recently, Uttarakhand former CM Trivendra Singh Rawat met the PM as well.  Several positions in the Cabinet are vacant due to the exit of Shiv Sena and Shiromani Akali Dal and the demise of Ramvilas Paswan of Jan Lokshakti Party.  Party sources had earlier stated that leaders from several key states like Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh are also expected to be accommodated in the expansion as the BJP aims to expand in these states in the future.

""Spoke on phone to His Holiness the @DalaiLama to convey greetings on his 86th birthday. We wish him a long and healthy life,"" Modi said in a tweet on Twitter. Interestingly, the PM did not convey his greetings to the Tibetan leader last year amid India's border stand-off with China. There were no public messages congratulating Dalai Lama from the President or the Prime Minister last year. The 14th Dalai Lama has been living in India since he fled China in 1959. The Tibetan spiritual leader the Dalai Lama celebrated turning 86 on Tuesday, thanking his supporters and expressing his appreciation for India, where he has lived since he fled his homeland in 1959. ""I want to express my deep appreciation of all my friends who have really shown me love, respect and trust,'' the Dalai Lama said in a video message.

(File photo)NEW DELHI: As the Center on Tuesday made seven changes in gubernatorial assignments, including fresh appointments, like senior cabinet minister Thawarchand Gehlot as governor of politically crucial Karnataka, the Modi government has tried to accommodate record number of SC/ST, OBC and women to the high office of Raj Bhawan. The governors’ appointments is yet another strong indication towards the Modi cabinet reshuffle, which is likely this week. On Tuesday, other than Gehlot, Hari babu Kambhampati was appointed as Governor of Mizoram, Mangubhai Chaganbhai Patel was appointed as Governor of Madhya Pradesh and Rajendran Vishwanath Arlekar was appointed as Governor of Himachal Pradesh. PS Sreedharan Pillai was transferred and appointed as Governor of Goa, Satyadev Narayan Arya was transferred and appointed as Governor of Tripura, Ramesh Bais was transferred as Governor of Jharkhand and Bandaru Dattatreya appointed as Governor of Haryana. With these appointments, a record number of SC, ST, OBC and women have been appointed as governors. A substantial number of gubernatorial assignments have been given to those hailing from SC communities. This includes Thawar Chand Gehlot, among the BJP’s tallest SC leaders and ex-Cabinet Minister, who will serve as the Governor of Karnataka. Rajendra Arlekar will now become the Governor of Himachal Pradesh. He has represented Pernem in the Goa Assembly. Satyadev Narayan Arya will take charge as the Governor of Tripura. Baby Rani Maurya is currently serving as Uttarakhand Governor. Governors from the Tribal community are Mangubhai Patel, who will now be Governor of Madhya Pradesh and is a long standing leader of the tribal communities with years of political experience in Gujarat. Anusuiya Uikey is the serving as Governor of Chattisgarh Besides, key governorships are being held by leaders who have worked for OBC aspirations. Phagu Chauhan who belongs to Lonia community from eastern UP is the Governor of Bihar. Ramesh Bais will now become the Governor of Jharkhand. Bandaru Dattatraya will be the Governor of Haryana after a stint in Himachal Pradesh. Ganga Prasad Chaurasiya is Governor of Sikkim. Tamilisai Soundararajan serves in Telangana with additional charge of Puducherry. Now, there are three governors from the Jat community. Perhaps it is for the first time in India’s history that there are three Governors belonging to the Jat Community, a Modi government’ strong message to the peasant community belonging to Punjab, Haryana and western UP where farm union protests are taking place.  Among Jat governor, Jagdeep Dhankar is in the politically crucial state of West Bengal. Acharya Devvrat is Governor of Prime Minister Modi’s home state Gujarat. Satyapal Malik is serving as Meghalaya Governor. Besides, two leading Muslim intellectuals are governors. Arif Mohammad Khan is the Governor of Kerala and Najma Heptulla is the Governor of Manipur.

India, which has had a big presence in Afghanistan since the fall of the Taliban in 2001 following the US invasion, has been helping the successive governments there including the members of the northern alliance who have been friends with India for a long time. ""With the Afghan security situation deteriorating, plans have been discussed for bringing back our citizens and officials present in different parts of that country and multiple agencies are in discussion for this purpose,"" sources in the government told ANI. India has its embassy in Kabul along with the consulates in Kandahar and Mazar where it has over 500 staff deployed. Two consulates in Herat and Jalalabad had ceased operations earlier there. The process is under discussion and it is not clear whether the entire workforce would return or some essential staff would be staying back in Afghanistan. Indian military officials have also been assisting in training the Afghan National Army personnel both in Afghanistan and India as well, the sources said. In view of the US decision to withdraw the entire force from Afghanistan, the Taliban troops have been capturing newer districts and areas at a lightning speed and the Afghan government forces are also fleeing from a number of places there. In Kandahar, the Taliban have captured important bridges and roads connecting the city with other parts and the Afghan officials are also taking steps to ensure their own security, reports from Afghanistan suggested. India has worked immensely for the redevelopment of Afghanistan and helped it to construct Parliament building along with several roads connecting important cities of the war-torn country. A large number of Afghan people have been receiving training in different skills as India has spent billions of dollars for capability enhancement of Afghan personnel.

A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud and M R Shah took serious note of Maharashtra government's shifting patients lodged in mental health institutes to homes for beggars and asked it to discontinue the practice immediately saying it is counter-productive and runs against the provisions of Mental Health Act. The top court also directed all the states and Union Territories to extend all cooperation and participate in the meeting of Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment to be held on July 12. It asked the states/UTs to remove the discrepancies in figures submitted about the people who have been cured but are still languishing in mental health institutions or who still needs treatments. The bench said that from now on it will monitor the case and would start listing the matter after three weeks as it is very sensitive matter. The top court was hearing a plea filed by advocate Gaurav Bansal in which he has said that around 10,000 people, who are fit to be discharged, are forced to live in different mental hospitals across the country and institutes due to social stigma.

According to the sources, the government is continuously in touch with Pfizer, but no decision has been taken particularly over granting protection against legal liability. Notably, in June, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla had said that the company is in the final stages to get approval for the Covid-19 vaccine in India. Meanwhile, another US giant drug maker Moderna's Covid-19 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine is expected to reach India this week. Last week, the Indian drug regulator had granted permission to Cipla to import donated doses of Moderna from the US.

In the morning, several BJP legislators squatted on the stairs of the legislature building and shouted slogans against the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA-comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress) government.  Fadnavis, who is the leader of opposition in the assembly, announced BJP MLA Kalidas Kolamkar as the ""speaker of the (counter) House"" and proposed to hold a discussion.  The former chief minister, while addressing the MLAs, claimed the 12 party legislators were suspended on the basis of false allegations.  ""Today, I propose a resolution against this government here and I request the members to start a discussion on the proposal,"" he said.  Fadnavis said his party MLAs want to speak against the functioning of this ""tyrant government"".  ""They want to expose this 'Vasooli' (extortionist) and corrupt government,"" he said.  Later, security officials stopped the BJP members from using loudspeakers even as they shouted slogans against the government.  Fadnavis told reporters that the government cannot stop the BJP from raising its voice against the ""high-handedness"" of the ruling dispensation.  ""Has the government imposed emergency?"" he asked. ""This is a black chapter...this is murder of democracy,"" the BJP leader alleged.  On Monday, 12 BJP MLAs were suspended from the Assembly for one year after the state government accused them of ""misbehaving"" with presiding officer Bhaskar Jadhav in the Speaker's chamber.  Fadnavis had termed the allegation as false and said Jadhav's account of the incident was ""one-sided"" .

The Odisha govt had earlier permitted Rath Yatra only at Puri and allowed rituals within temple premises of all other Jagannath temples. A plea was filed in the Supreme Court against the Orissa High Court order dismissing a batch of petitions challenging the state government's directive to restrict observing of Rath Yatra in temples due to Covid, and it said a total ban on the ritual will be “against the right to religion”. The apex court said it it agrees with the decision of the Odisha govt order given the fears of Covid spread. A bench headed CJI N V Ramana was informed by Odisha govt that it would be impossible for the state to ensure observance of strict Covid protocol in thousands of Jagannath temples across the state. CJI Ramana said that he is a devotee of Lord Jagannath and wants to visit Puri temple for last one and a half years. The Chief Justice told petitioners, seeking the Rath Yatra in other places alongside Puri: ""You want to pray to the God. You can do it from home. I also wanted to go to Puri but I couldn't in the last one and half years. This isn't the time"". “But situation is such that I have to pray from a distance. If Rath Yatra is permitted, it will be the devotees who could suffer and we don’t want to take the risk,” he said. Dismissing the petitions, Chief Justice N.V. Ramana observed: ""Last year few people died, this year many people died (due to Covid). We hope God will allows us these rituals next year."" The Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath in Puri is an annual ritual and this time it is scheduled for July 12.

Both Congress and BJP, along with Jammu and Kashmir's Panthers Party welcomed the move of the Election Commission and said they will meet the delegation and demand fair representation of all communities.  BJP's Jammu and Kashmir unit president Ravinder Raina said his party's delegation will demand a ""lawful and logical delimitation"" from the commission.  ""In 1985, the delimitation of assembly seats in Jammu and Kashmir is still questioned till this day. BJP will demand a delimitation where nobody is discriminated against and everyone is given equal representation,"" he said.  Elaborating further, BJP leader Kavinder Gupta said his party wants delimitation to be done on two parts -- hill area and plains.  ""Voters should also be a factor in making constituencies. We hope that constituencies that will come up now will give justice to Jammu and Kashmir,"" said Gupta.  Congress on the other hand demanded the delimitation commission to spend more time on the grassroots level to understand ground realities and sentiments.  Ravinder Sharma of Congress while talking to ANI said, ""in the all-party meeting, Congress had suggested that the delimitation commission should visit the region to get different shades of political opinion. Congress has decided that we will meet the delegation of commission in both Jammu and Kashmir. We will demand the delegation to share the data that they have. We will also ask them to visit the grassroots level.""  He further said that the two-day visit is not enough and demanded the commission to use its resources to meet people on the district and constituency levels.  ""Meeting representatives of seven districts in an hour is not justified. The commission has been working on delimitation for over a year and conducting everything in two days won't to justified. We want them to visit on district and constituency levels and listen to political representatives carefully. They have the resources to do that. We would want the voice of the people on the ground to reach the commission,"" he added. Panthers Party chief Bhim Singh also welcomed the delimitation commission's move to visit the UT and said the commission should divide equal seats between Jammu and Kashmir.  ""To end the tension, equal seats should be given to both Jammu and Kashmir. There is an internal tension in Jammu and Kashmir which leads to the rise of communal-minded people,"" said Singh.  However, the Panthers Party chief added at as the census of 2021-2022 is going to start soon, the commission should do a provisional delimitation in Jammu and Kashmir before the assembly polls.  The delimitation commission, tasked with redrawing parliamentary and assemblies constituencies in Jammu and Kashmir, is scheduled to visit the Union Territory from July 6 to July 9 and interact with administrative officials, political parties and public representatives there.  The decision to visit Jammu and Kashmir was taken after the panel held a meeting at the Election Commission office in the national capital on June 30.  Prime Minister Narendra Modi had held a meeting with political leaders from Jammu and Kashmir on June 24 and said it was an important step in the ongoing efforts towards a developed and progressive region.

""I want to express my deep appreciation of all my friends who have really shown me love, respect and trust,"" the Dalai Lama said in a video message. He reiterated his mission to serving humanity and urged supporters to be compassionate. ""Since I became a refugee and now settled in India, I have taken full advantage of India's freedom and religious harmony,"" he said. He added that he had great respect for India's secular values such as ""honesty, karuna (compassion), and ahimsa (non-violence)."" The Dalai Lama made the hillside town of Dharmsala his headquarters after a failed uprising against Chinese rule in 1959. China doesn't recognize the Tibetan government-in-exile and accuses the Dalai Lama of seeking to separate Tibet from China. The Dalai Lama denies being a separatist and says he merely advocates for substantial autonomy and protection of Tibet's native Buddhist culture. On Tuesday, a small celebration attended by mostly government officials was held at the Central Tibetan Administration. On a projected screen, the Dalai Lama's video message was played and followed by a cultural performance by the Tibetan Institute of Performing Arts. Usually, the spiritual leader's birthday is a fairly elaborate affair in the town, open to members of the public who would flock to the Tsuglakhang temple where performances were held. Sometimes, the leader would also make an appearance. This year, due to the coronavirus pandemic, the celebrations were muted and behind closed doors. But a banner marking his birthday hung in the town square and Tibetan monks distributed sweets and juice to passers-by outside the closed temple. ""Many people really show they love me. And many people actually love my smile,"" the Dalai Lama said with a smile at the start of the video. ""In spite of my old age, my face is quite handsome,"" he said with a laugh.

Devi, 35, had to mortgage her land for a 20,000 rupee ($270) loan and six month on, as the money runs out, she has stopped buying milk, halved her use of cooking oil and can afford lentils only about once every 10 days. With her construction worker husband jobless, she's facing going deeper into debt to get by. ""Sometimes I go to sleep hungry. Last week, I think I went to bed hungry at least twice but I can't remember,"" Devi told Reuters as she wiped away tears with her threadbare sari outside her mud house in her village in Uttar Pradesh state. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has promised free foodgrains for the poor but the rations are limited and not enough for the family, Devi said. The coronavirus and a lockdown aimed at stopping it last year saw millions of people thrown out of jobs in cities and towns and forced back to their villages, and ever higher levels of debt. Interviews with 75 households in a cluster of eight villages in India's most populous state showed household incomes have slumped nearly 75% on average. Almost two thirds of the households have taken on debt. Devi’s husband used to have a job in construction in the more prosperous state of Punjab to the northwest, which kept the family going. Now the job has gone and he's back home and struggling to find work. Others like him who have lost jobs crowd around a brick kiln near their village every day hoping for work. Holding back recovery Big debt and low income in the countryside will hold back any economic recovery the government is trying to generate and also dent private savings and investment for longer than expected, economists say. ""It will have a huge impact and prolong the recovery process. Private consumption and investments both will be hurt. There is merit in finding ways to put money in the hands of the people,"" said N.R. Bhanumurthy, economist and vice chancellor at Bengaluru-based B.R Ambedkar School of Economics. India's gross domestic product fell by a record 7.3% in the year that ended on March 31. The government has forecast 10.5% growth for 2021/2022 but a second wave of the pandemic has dented expectations and several economists have cut their forecasts. The poor have especially been hit hard. The Reuters investigation showed most of the 75 households in the Uttar Pradesh cluster, a combined 518 people, have taken out total debt of 6.12 million rupees ($82,250), more than 80% of which remains unserviced, the householders said. Borrowing has risen by three times since the pandemic hit in March 2020 and about half of that was taken out the past six months, the survey found. With no jobs or with bread-winners sick, the cumulative monthly income of the 75 households has dropped to about 220,000 rupees ($2,960) from 815,000 rupees ($10,960) before the pandemic. ""Almost everyone is in debt in this village ... unemployment is the biggest problem,"" said 55-year Komal Prasad, a former headman of Gauriya, a hamlet in the cluster with a population of just over 2,000 people. Only about 30% of the people in Gauriya had a job or were looking for work, many fewer than before, villagers said. Juggi Lal, a 35-year-old farmhand, said she was struggling to buy medicine for her disabled husband because there was no work and she owed 60,000 rupees ($806) to a moneylender. ""Every morning I wake up thinking what work will I get, how will I get through the day?"" Rural unemployment rate, which used to hover around 6% before the pandemic, rose to 8.75% in June, according to the Mumbai-based Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). Ripple effectThe mix of lower incomes, higher debt and rising prices of staples is dampening demand in the countryside where two-thirds of Indians live. Sales of everything from biscuits, tea and lentils to auto parts have taken a hit, vendors say. Some have shut down shops that their families have run for generations. Gosh Mohammed, 43, used to sell up to 8,000 rupees ($107) of groceries a day before the pandemic. Now it's down to 1,000 rupees ($13.5) a day. He has taken 60,000 rupees worth of goods from a wholesaler on credit but hasn't been able to pay it off for six months. ""I never used to take goods on credit because buying with cash gets us more of a discount,"" Mohammed said. ""Now I think I'll have to shut my shop as wholesalers have stopped giving me credit and I've sold the goods on credit and that money isn't likely to come back.""

Expansions and restructuring of ministries are avoided when the two Houses are in session and this, though only a convention, has been followed with, perhaps, just one exception. On Monday, the talk about inclusion of 17- 22 ministers acquired tremendous velocity. Jyotiraditya Scindia, who crossed over from Congress along with supporters bringing about the downfall of Congress government in Madhya Pradesh, and Sarbanand Sonowal, who was made to step aside for Himanta Biswa Sarma in Assam, have been on the ""wait list"" for a bit too long despite leadership's known readiness to give them their due. BJP has also to accommodate its allies. Though a coalition, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's team has only one representative- Ramdas Athawale, leader of Dalit outfit, RPI—from a non-BJP constituent of NDA after Shiv Sena's Arvind Sawant and Shiromani Akali Dal's Harsimrat Kaur Badal pulled out because of rupture in ties and LJP founder Ramvilas Paswan passed away. JD(U), which turned down the offer— accepted by Sena— of a solitary cabinet berth in 2019, has staked its claim for adequate representation in the team when it is enlarged. Party president RCP Singh, senior functionary Rajiv Ranjan Singh ""Lalan"" and Santosh Kushwaha have been discussed among possibilities. Apna Dal's Anupriya Patel, who was left out two years ago, cannot be ignored because of the party's need to keep her Kurmi community in UP in good humour ahead of state polls. Pashupati Paras, who along with four LJP MPs dislodged Chirag Paswan as the leader of LJP, is learnt to be looking forward to his inclusion, an aspiration which has the support of Bihar CM Nitish Kumar who played a key role in the split of Paswan’s outfit. Sushil Modi, former Bihar deputy chief minister, who has been shifted to Delhi and is now a member of Rajya Sabha, is seen as a ""hot probable"" because of his experience as well as strong reputation for mastery of facts and devotion to task. He was kept out of the state ministry when JDU-BJP alliance won last year.

The accused, identified only as Klaus L., is suspected of ""regularly passing on information to Chinese intelligence ahead of or after state visits or multinational conferences"" between 2010 and 2019. Klaus L. had been running a political think tank since 2001, gaining international importance due to his scientific reputation and networks he had built up over many years, the prosecutors said. He was approached by members of a Chinese intelligence service during a lecture tour to Shanghai in June 2010, they said. The suspect obtained information primarily from his numerous high-ranking political contacts gained through his work, the prosecutors said. He was paid for his work and the Chinese intelligence service also arranged for him to travel to the meetings with its officers, including as part of a social programme. According to a report by German public broadcaster ARD, Klaus L. led a double life and had also been working as a spy for the German intelligence services (BND). The broadcaster named the think tank as the Hanns Seidel Foundation, which is close to the CSU, the smaller Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel's CDU. The suspect is due to appear before a judge later on Tuesday.

Dozens in the pro-Trump mob openly bragged about their actions on January 6 on social media and were captured in shocking footage broadcast live by national news outlets. But six months after the insurrection, the justice department is still hunting for scores of rioters, even as the first of more than 500 people already arrested have pleaded guilty. The struggle reflects the massive scale of the investigation and the grueling work still ahead for authorities in the face of an increasing effort by some Republican lawmakers to rewrite what happened that day. Among those who still haven't been caught: the person who planted two pipe bombs outside the offices of the Republican and Democratic national committees the night before the melee, as well as many people accused of attacks on law enforcement officers or violence and threats against journalists. The FBI website seeking information about those involved in the Capitol violence includes more than 900 pictures of roughly 300 people labeled ""unidentified."" Part of the problem is that authorities made very few arrests on January 6. They were focused instead on clearing the building of members of the massive mob that attacked police, damaged historic property and combed the halls for lawmakers they threatened to kill. Federal investigators are forced to go back and hunt down participants. The FBI has since received countless tips and pieces of digital media from the public. But a tip is only the first step of a painstaking process — involving things like search warrants and interviews — to confirm people's identities and their presence at the insurrection in order to bring a case in court. And authorities have no record of many of the attackers because this was their first run-in with the law. ""Most of these people never showed up on the radar screen before,"" said Frank Montoya Jr, a retired FBI special agent who led the bureau's field offices in Seattle and Honolulu. ""You watch the movies and a name comes up on the radar screen and they know all the aliases and the last place he ate dinner, all with a click of a button. Unfortunately, that's not how it is in reality."" The FBI has been helped by ""sedition hunters,"" or armchair detectives who have teamed up to identify some of the most elusive suspects, using crowdsourcing to pore over the vast trove of videos and photos from the assault. Forrest Rogers, a business consultant who helped form a group of sedition hunters called ""Deep State Dogs,"" said the group has reported the possible identities of about 100 suspects to the FBI based on evidence it collected. Sometimes, a distinctive article of clothing helps the group make a match. In one case, a woman carrying a unique iPhone case on January 6 had been photographed with the same case at an earlier protest, Rogers said. ""It's seeking justice,"" he said. ""This is something that's unprecedented in the history of our country."" Rogers asked, ""Where else have you had several thousands of people who commit a crime and then immediately disperse all over the United States?"" John Scott-Railton is a senior researcher at the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto who has been collaborating with journalists and others to identify suspects using digital clues. He said that while much is known about the ""small fish"" who committed crimes that day, a deeper understanding is needed of the actions of organized group leaders. ""We all need to be in a place where we can have conversations about what January 6 was that go beyond a bunch of individuals motivated by a set of ideologies who showed up at the Capitol,"" he said. Those being sought include many accused of violent attacks on officers. One video released by the FBI shows an unidentified man attacking officers with a baton. In another, a man is seen ripping the gas mask off an officer who screamed in pain as he was being crushed into a doorway by the angry mob. In some cases, social media platforms have turned over incriminating posts that defendants tried to delete after their gleeful celebrations of the siege gave way to fears of being arrested. Often, the attackers' own family, friends or acquaintances tipped off authorities. In one case, the FBI used facial comparison software to find a suspect on his girlfriend's Instagram account. Agents then went undercover, secretly recorded the man at work and got him on tape admitting to being in the crowd, which he described as “fun.” ""The more of these people you identify — potentially through search warrants and social media communications — you're going to be able to identify others,"" said Tom O'Connor, who focused on counterterrorism as a special agent before leaving the bureau in 2019. ""Those people who have been arrested will then be given the opportunity to cooperate and identify other persons involved."" The FBI has offered a reward of up to $100,000 for information leading to the arrest of the person responsible for planting the pipe bombs in Washington on January 5. Footage shows a person in a gray hooded sweatshirt, a mask and gloves appearing to place one of the explosives under a bench outside the Democratic National Committee and the person walking in an alley near the Republican National Committee before the bomb was placed there. It remains unclear whether the bombs were related to planning for the insurrection. Justice department officials say arresting everyone involved in the insurrection remains a top priority. Authorities recently arrested the 100th person accused of assaulting law enforcement as well as the first person accused of assaulting a member of the press — a man prosecutors say tackled a cameraman. ""They will find them,"" said Robert Anderson Jr, former executive assistant director of the FBI's Criminal, Cyber, Response, and Services Branch. ""I don't care how long it takes. If they are looking for them, they will find them."" More than a dozen January 6 defendants have pleaded guilty, including two members of the Oath Keepers militia group who admitted to conspiring with other extremists to block the certification of President Joe Biden's victory. Most of the other plea deals reached so far are in cases where defendants were charged only with misdemeanors for illegally entering the Capitol. The only defendant who has been sentenced is an Indiana woman who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor and was spared any time behind bars.

Viktor Babariko, the former chief executive of a Russia-owned bank, aspired to challenge Belarus' authoritarian president, Alexander Lukashenko, in last year's election. But Babariko was arrested two months before the August 2020 vote. His arrest drew thousands of protesters to the streets. At the time, he was widely perceived as a top contender in the race. Babariko has remained in jail since his arrest and rejected the corruption charges against him as politically driven. On Tuesday, he was found guilty of taking a bribe and money laundering. The court handed him a 14-year prison sentence and a fine roughly the equivalent of $57,000. He will not be able to appeal the Supreme Court verdict. Lukashenko's reelection to a sixth term last year prompted months of mass protests, the largest of which drew up to 200,000 people. The opposition refused to recognize the results of the election, saying that the vote was manipulated. Authorities responded to the demonstrations with a massive crackdown that saw more than 35,000 people arrested and thousands beaten by police. Most opposition leaders have been jailed or forced to leave the country.

Abu Alaa al-Walae, commander of Kataib Sayyid al-Shuhada, said in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press in Baghdad that the electoral victory of Iran's hard-line judiciary chief Ebrahim Raisi as president will strengthen Iran-backed militant groups throughout the Middle East for the next four years. Al-Walae, who rarely gives interviews to foreign media organizations, spoke to the AP on Monday in an office in a Baghdad neighborhood along the Tigris River. On June 27, U.S. Air Force planes carried out airstrikes near the Iraq-Syria border against what the Pentagon said were facilities used by Iran-backed militia groups to support drone strikes inside Iraq. Four militiamen were killed. The Popular Mobilization Forces, an Iraqi state-sanctioned umbrella of mostly Shiite militias _ including those targeted by the U.S. strikes _ said their men were on missions to prevent infiltration by the Islamic State group and denied the presence of weapons warehouses. U.S. troops in eastern Syria came under rocket fire the day after the airstrikes, with no reported casualties. The U.S. has blamed Iran-backed militias for attacks _ most of them rocket strikes _ that have targeted the American presence in Baghdad and military bases across Iraq. More recently, the attacks have become more sophisticated, with militants using drones. U.S. military officials have grown increasingly alarmed over drone strikes targeting U.S. military bases in Iraq, more common since a U.S. drone killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani near the Baghdad airport last year. Iraqi militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis was also killed in the attack. The strike drew the ire of mostly Shiite Iraqi lawmakers and prompted parliament to pass a nonbinding resolution to pressure the Iraqi government to oust foreign troops from the country. In mid-April, an explosives-laden drone targeted the military section of the international airport in Irbil, in Iraq's northern Kurdish-run region, causing no casualties or damages. The base also hosts American troops. U.S. officials said Iran-backed militias have conducted at least five drone attacks since April. After midnight Monday, a drone was shot down near the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad. There were no casualties. Two U.S. military officials said the drone was launched by Iranian proxies, adding that it was weaponized with explosives and was loitering over the U.S.-led coalition base in Baghdad. The officials said it was too early to identify the type of the drone. The U.S. Embassy said defense systems at the compound ``engaged and eliminated an airborne threat.'' The statement added that ``we are working with our Iraqi partners to investigate'' the attack. The bearded al-Walae, wearing a black shirt and trousers and an olive-green baseball cap, hinted that his militiamen might use drones in future attacks. He did not go into details. When asked if they used drones in the past against American troops in Iraq, he gave no straight answer and moved to other subjects. ``We want an operation that befits those martyrs,'' he said referring to the four fighters killed in late June. ``Even if it comes late, time is not important.'' ``We want it to be an operation in which everyone says they have taken revenge on the Americans,'' al-Walae said. ``It will be a qualitative operation (that could come) from the air, the sea, along Iraq's border, in the region or anywhere. It's an open war.'' Al-Walae spoke in an office decorated with a poster of Soleimani. On a table next to him, a framed photo shows al-Walae standing next to Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Lebanon's Hezbollah group. Al-Walae praised Iran's new president, Raisi, who is scheduled to take office next month, saying Iran-backed militant groups ``will have their best times.'' Days after he was elected last month, Raisi said in his first remarks after the vote that he rejects the possibility of meeting with President Joe Biden or negotiating Tehran's ballistic missile program and support of regional militias. Al-Walae, who was once held prisoner by U.S. troops in Iraq, boasted that his men were among the first to go to neighboring Syria to fight alongside President Bashar Assad's forces in 2012, a year after the civil war there broke out. He said their first mission was to protect a Shiite holy shrine south of the capital, Damascus. They later fought in different parts of Syria. Iran-backed fighters from throughout the region have joined Syria's conflict, helping tip the balance of power in Assad's favor. Thousands of Iran-backed fighters remain in Syria, many of them deployed close to the Iraqi border in the towns of Boukamal and Mayadeen. Al-Walae also said he doesn't expect Iraq's parliamentary elections to take place on time in October, saying they might be postponed until April next year. He attributed the delay to the deep crisis the country is experiencing, including severe electricity cuts during the scorching summer.

Here are some key figures about the conflict with US and foreign troops having all but withdrawn from Afghanistan: At its peak, under president Barack Obama in 2011, the United States had 98,000 personnel on the ground, according to Pentagon figures. A Nato alliance of 38 countries committed to the Afghan conflict in December 2001, but the United States has always provided the largest military contingent. As of February 2020, when Washington signed a deal with the Taliban committing to withdrawing its troops, the Pentagon estimated that around 14,000 remained in the country. By May 1, 2021 -- the original deadline for the withdrawal, pushed back to September 11 by new President Joe Biden -- there were about 9,500 foreign troops in Afghanistan, of which American troops made up the largest contingent of 2,500. Just over 38,000 civilians were killed between 2009 and the end of 2020, according to the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, which began systematically recording civilian casualties in 2009. The deadliest year was 2018. More than 70,000 others were wounded over the same period. In the last three years, more than 395,800 Afghans have been displaced, the Ministry of Refugees and Repatriation said. The United States has paid the highest price in terms of foreign fatalities in Afghanistan, with more than 2,400 military personnel killed and more than 20,700 wounded. As for other Nato coalition members, Britain lost the second-highest number of personnel, with 455 killed, according to icasualties.org, which monitors the dead and wounded in conflicts such as Afghanistan. The Afghan government no longer publishes data for losses within its army, which are significant, but President Ashraf Ghani in 2019 said more than 45,000 members of the country's security forces have been killed since 2014, when he became leader. As of September 30, 2019, the Pentagon officially estimated the cost of US operations in Afghanistan at $776 billion since 2001. Of that total, $197.3 billion was earmarked for reconstruction of the war-ravaged country and its institutions. But according to a study by Brown University, the cost of America's wars exceeds the Pentagon's estimate, as State Department aid is not taken into account, nor are any intelligence operations or the medical costs of wounded veterans. Factoring in all those costs, the Brown researchers say the US ""wars on terror"" in Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan since 2001 have cost $6.4 trillion. Before being deposed in 2001, the Taliban banned girls from studying and stoned to death women accused of crimes such as adultery. Afghanistan's Ministry of Education said there are now around 9.7 million children enrolled in schools, 42 percent of them girls. There are currently 18,000 active schools across the country, up from 3,000 two decades ago. There are 68 women lawmakers in the Afghan parliament, about 30 percent of the lower house. Over the past two decades, women have also held senior political and government positions such as senators, ministers and governors. Between 2003 to 2018, the infant mortality rate fell from 53 to 23 per 1,000 live births, according to the World Bank.

On Monday, lightning forced crews to pause the search for victims of the June 24 collapse in Surfside and a garage area in the rubble filled with water, officials said. The latest forecasts showed Tropical Storm Elsa moving westward, mostly sparing South Florida, but the area near the collapsed building experienced thunderstorms, and another day of unsettled weather was expected. The delays frustrated rescue crews, Miami-Dade County mayor Daniella Levine Cava said. ""Truly they live to save lives, and they've pushed ahead no matter what is thrown in their way,"" she said at an evening news conference. Still, crews got a big boost when the unstable remaining portion of the Champlain Towers South building came down on Sunday. The demolition — prompted by fears that the structure could fall — allowed rescuers into previously inaccessible places, including bedrooms where people were believed to be sleeping at the time of the disaster, officials said. Four more victims were discovered, raising the death toll to 28 people. Another 117 people remained unaccounted for. ""The site is busier and more active now than I've seen it since we began, now that the damaged building is down,"" Surfside mayor Charles Burkett said, adding that heavy equipment was now able to move freely around the site. Rescuers hoped to get a clearer picture of voids that may exist in the rubble as they search for anyone still trapped under the fallen wing of the building, but they found very few voids, Miami-Dade assistant fire chief Raide Jadallah told family members late on Monday. No one has been rescued alive since the first hours after the collapse, but rescuers were still holding out hope of reuniting loved ones. ""We continue to remain focused on our primary mission, and that is to leave no stone unturned and to find as many people as we can and to help bring either some answers to family and loved ones or to bring some closure to them,"" City of Miami fire rescue captain Ignatius Carroll said.

It was the first major political test for Prime Minister Naftali Bennett, who for nearly a month now has been heading a narrow and diverse coalition that includes left-wing, centrist and Arab parties, along with his own ultranationalist party. And he came up short in the early morning vote, failing to secure a simple majority in parliament to extend the so-called Citizenship and Entry Into Israel Law, and underscoring his government's fragility. The vote was tied 59-59. The law prevents Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip who marry Israeli citizens from automatically gaining Israeli residency and citizenship, although exceptions are made on a case-by-case basis. Israel first passed the law in 2003, during the height of a Palestinian uprising, saying Palestinians who married Israeli citizens used their legal status to help carry out attacks against Israel. It was enacted for one year and has been extended on an annual basis, including by former Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who now leads the opposition. Netanyahu, who calls Bennett's government a threat to Israel's security, refused to give him a lifeline and voted against it. Bennett last month reached a power sharing deal with centrist Yair Lapid to unseat Netanyahu. Together they put together a coalition of parties with 62 of 120 seats in parliament. Under the deal Lapid, now foreign minister, will take over as prime minister after two years. A few coalition party members did not vote in favour of the extending the law, including a member of Bennett's own party.

The Afghan military exodus comes as Taliban overrun most districts in northeastern Badakhshan province. Many of the districts collapsed without a fight but along the province's northern border with Tajikistan, hundreds of Afghan National Security and Defense Forces crossed the border seeking safety. The consulates of Turkey and Russia have reportedly closed in Mazar-e-Sharif, the capital of northern Balkh province, and Afghanistan's fourth-largest city. Iran said it has restricted activities at its consulate in the city. There has been fighting in Balkh province, but the provincial capital has been relatively peaceful. The consulates of Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, India and Pakistan have reduced their services, Balkh provincial governor's spokesman Munir Farhad said Tuesday. He said Turkey and Russia had closed their consulates and their diplomats had left the city. The Tajik government said Afghan troops were being allowed to cross on humanitarian grounds but the border posts on the Tajik side were in control of Tajik forces and there was no fighting with Taliban from the Tajik side. The Taliban march gains momentum only days after the United States vacated Bagram Airfield, just an hours drive north of the capital and a sure sign that the majority of its troops had left Afghanistan. The US withdrew from what had been the epicenter of the US-led coalition's nearly 20-year war in Afghanistan by s hutting off the electricity and slipping away in the night without notifying the base's new Afghan commander, who discovered the Americans' departure more than two hours after they left, according Afghan military officials said. Meanwhile Moscow also weighed in on Monday with Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov saying there is ""heightened concern"" over the fighting but Russia has no plans to send troops to assist its former republic. ""We have repeatedly said many times that after the withdrawal of the Americans and their allies from Afghanistan, the development of the situation in this country is a matter of our heightened concern,"" Peskov said. ""We're monitoring it very closely and are noting that destabilization (of the situation) is taking place, unfortunately."" Meanwhile, Tajikistan's state news agency Khovar counted 1,037 Afghan military personnel who entered Tajikistan while fleeing for their lives. It said Monday they used seven of the crossings along the countries' shared 910-kilometer (565-mile) border. The Taliban have made relentless territorial wins since mid-April, when President Joe Biden announced the last 2,500-3,500 US soldiers and 7,000 allied Nato soldiers would leave Afghanistan. Most have left quietly already, well before the announced deadline in September. The full withdrawal is not expected to be completed until the end of August while agreements to protect Kabul's Hamid Karzai International Airport are settled. Meanwhile, the months-old peace talks being held in Qatar between Taliban and a fractious Afghan government have all but stopped even as both sides say they want a negotiated end to the decades-long conflict. With their victories in northern and southern Afghanistan, the Taliban are putting pressure on provincial cities and gaining control of key transportation routes. The Afghan government has resurrected militias mostly loyal to Kabul-allied warlords but with a history of brutal violence that has raised the specter of civil war similar to the fighting that devastated Kabul in the early 1990s. The Taliban wins in northern Afghanistan are particularly significant because that part of the country is the traditional stronghold of US-allied warlords and the scene of the Taliban's initial widespread losses in 2001 when the US-led coalition launched its battle to unseat the religious movement.

The sprawling military complex was at one point home to tens of thousands of US and allied soldiers, and one of the most important sites to prosecute the two-decade war in Afghanistan. But the last of the American soldiers quietly left the base last week, effectively completing their withdrawal from Afghanistan and leaving a massive security vacuum that the Afghan military will struggle to fill. The new commander of the Bagram base, General Mirassadullah Kohistani, on Monday spoke candidly about the challenges ahead, as reporters were given a tour of the largely deserted base. ""You know, if we compare ourselves with the Americans, it's a big difference,"" Kohistani said, admitting his forces could not be as ""powerful"" as the Americans. ""But according to our capabilities... we are trying to do the best and as much as possible secure and serve all the people."" The lack of a clear handover or transition plan appears to have made the task even more challenging. Kohistani said he only knew of the foreign forces' exit after they had left. ""We did not know of their timeline for departure. They did not tell us when they left."" Just 50 kilometres (30 miles) from Kabul, the base is key to the security of the capital while also providing strategic cover to much of the country's rugged north where the Taliban have focused their recent offensives. Kohistani insists his troops can hold the base from the Taliban, and that he has ""quite enough"" soldiers. Though, with roughly 3,000 troops under his command, the figure is a tiny percentage of the number of American and allied forces during its US-led heyday. For American troops, morale was kept up in the then-buzzing mini-city with swimming pools, cinemas, spas and fast food outlets of Burger King and Pizza Hut. For Kohistani's men, the entertainment venues are closed, the warehouses are locked and the shuttered dining facilities offer only the stench of rotten food from boxes of expired meal packs. In a more concrete sign of the Afghan military's ability to fight without American backing, 1,000 troops fighting the Taliban in the country's north fled into neighbouring Tajikistan on Monday. At Bagram, Kohistani said he was already receiving reports that the Taliban were making ""movements in rural areas"" surrounding the area. One soldier, a private named Rafiullah, offered a clear picture of what he expected would come. ""The enemy are determined and will definitely try to attack here,"" Rafiullah said as behind him two Afghan military helicopters took off. ""But we will not give them the chance."" If or when the Taliban do mount an offensive to take Bagram, one of their top priorities will undoubtedly be a huge prison that holds up to 5,000 Taliban inmates. ""We haven't come here to sleep. Everybody here is prepared to secure Bagram. Our morale is high,"" insisted Rafiullah. Another soldier also defiantly said he was ready to fight the Taliban, but nevertheless signalled a feeling of unease with a lack of firepower and leadership. ""We will not surrender but we need weapons and strong backing from our leaders,"" he said. If the Taliban do wrest control of Bagram, it will repeat a pattern of modern history reflecting the nation's power struggles. The airfield was first built by the Americans for its Afghan ally during the Cold War in the 1950s. The Soviet Union vastly expanded it after the Red Army invaded Afghanistan in 1979. After their withdrawal, the base was controlled by the Moscow-backed government, and later by the shaky mujahideen administration during the 1990s civil war. It was reported that at one point the Taliban controlled one end of the three-kilometre (two-mile) runway, and the opposition Northern Alliance the other. Bagram ultimately fell into the Taliban's hands after they overran large swathes of the country in the mid-1990s. Following the September 11 attacks and the US invasion of Afghanistan, the Americans took control of the base and used it as the launching pad for air strikes against the Taliban and to protect Afghan forces.

TAIPEI(TAIWAN): The Taipei government has termed China's ""one country and two systems"" as a facade, stating that it is really intended to annexe Taiwan. This comes after the Taiwan government recalled seven representative officials from Hong Kong, citing ""unreasonable political preconditions"". According to the concept of ""one country, two systems"", two systems will be practiced within the sovereign state of the People's Republic of China. During a TV interview, Chiu Chui-cheng, the Deputy Minister of Taipei's Mainland Affairs Council, said the Hong Kong government was reassuring Taiwan's representative offices in Hong Kong and Macau to sign a ""one China"" commitment letter, Taiwan News reported. This would have given validity to Beijing's ""one China"" principle, which Taiwan would never accept, he said. Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades. Chiu also pointed out that the Hong Kong government did not require other foreign embassies to sign such a document. Seven staff members flew out of Hong Kong last month and just one Taiwanese employee is left in the office. ""Our staff in Hong Kong did not break any local laws or regulations while carrying out their duties,"" Chiu said, adding that the Taiwan office will remain open with the help of 50 local staff members. The Deputy Minister also said that he hopes Taiwan will become the new home for Hongkongers as Beijing tightens its control over the semi-autonomous Chinese city. The diplomatic tensions between Hong Kong and Taiwan are rising in the last few months. Hong Kong and Macau closed their trade offices in Taipei and Beijing seeks to pile diplomatic and economic pressure on Taiwan.

(Photo credit: AP)TOKYO: More than 1,000 soldiers and rescue workers joined an increasingly desperate search on Tuesday for survivors in a Japanese resort town devastated by a landslide three days ago. Four people have been confirmed dead after the disaster in Atami in central Japan and officials said they were still unable to clarify the fate or whereabouts of 24 other residents. Helicopter images showed a bleak line of sludge and rubble snaking down a hillside district of Atami, a popular hot-spring destination. Rescuers crawled through destroyed homes and waded across vast piles of mud at the very end of the 72 hours that experts say are crucial in the race to save lives. ""There is only so much time left. We will give all we have during the time we have left and pray that we will be able to find as many people as possible,"" Atami Mayor Sakae Saito told a meeting of local officials on Tuesday morning. At one point the number of residents unaccounted for stood at more than 100, but officials said they had managed to track most of them down and confirm they were safe. ""Those who remain unaccounted for stands at 24 individuals,"" Saito said at the televised meeting. Confirming the number of people missing after the disaster has been complicated many families have summer homes in Atami but actually live elsewhere, while elderly residents may have moved to care homes, local media said. The landslide descended in several violent waves on Saturday morning during Japan's annual rainy season. It followed days of intense downpours in and around Atami, which is around 90 kilometres (55 miles) southwest of Tokyo. Pylons were toppled, vehicles buried and buildings tipped from their foundations in the disaster, which wrecked 130 homes and other buildings. City officials said on Monday they had identified one of the dead as 82-year-old Chiyose Suzuki. Her eldest son Hitoshi, 56, told Kyodo that he regretted not bringing his mother who could not walk well with him when police told them to evacuate. ""I should have gone back and taken her out of there myself"" instead of leaving her behind, he was quoted as saying. Suzuki was taken to hospital by rescuers but died there. Atami reportedly recorded more rainfall in 48 hours than it usually does for the whole of July, and survivors told local media they had never experienced such strong rain in their lives. Scientists say climate change is intensifying Japan's rainy season because a warmer atmosphere holds more water. In 2018, more than 200 people died as devastating floods inundated western Japan, and last year dozens were killed as the coronavirus pandemic complicated relief efforts.

(AP)HAVANA: Tropical storm Elsa's center looked set to exit Cuba late on Monday near Havana, churning on track to Florida although the lopsided weather system was expected to dump heavy rains over the Caribbean's largest island in its wake. At 0900 pm., the storm's center was 40 km (25 miles) to the south-east of the capital which was still experiencing calm weather conditions, Cuba's Meteorology Institute said, as it crossed the country's center from south to north slowly at 20 km per hour. Sustained winds were peaking near 85 kmph (50 mph) while storm surges were affecting Cuba's southern coast and would start occurring on the northern coast too, the institute said, causing light flooding in the capital in lower lying coastal areas such as along its famous Malecon seaside corniche. ""The rain is coming behind the centre so the fact it is moving out to sea along the northern coast between Havana and Mayabeque ... does not mean the rain is over,"" Cuba's best known meteorologist Jose Rubiera said on state television. More than 100,000 people in Cuba evacuated from flood-prone areas or unsafe housing in the potential path of the storm, most going to homes of family and friends, but thousands also to government shelters, state-run media reported. While such preparedness has typically enabled Cuba to avoid the kind of casualties from storms seen elsewhere, it comes amid Cuba's worst coronavirus outbreak since the start of the pandemic, raising fears that evacuations could fuel infections. Elsa already caused at least three direct deaths and some damages to infrastructure and agriculture in Caribbean islands southeast of Cuba like St Lucia and the Dominican Republic. It comes as the tourism-reliant archipelago is already struggling with the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic and bracing for an above-active hurricane season. Cuban meteorologists said the rains from Elsa could prove positive for agriculture, bolstering water reservoirs, as long as they were not too intense. Rainfall of 5 to 10 inches (13 to 25 cm) with isolated maximum amounts of 15 inches (38 cm) was forecast across parts of Cuba on Monday night and expected to result in ""significant flash flooding and mudslides,"" the Miami-based U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. A tropical storm watch and storm surge watch were in place for much of the western coast of Florida, the NHC said, with Elsa expected to strengthen out at sea as it passed near the Florida Keys early Tuesday and moved near or over portions of the west coast of Florida on Tuesday and Wednesday. The approach of the storm forced Florida officials to demolish the remaining portion of a condo building that collapsed 11 days ago, killing at least 24 people with over 120 still missing. But revised predictions showing Elsa tracking to make landfall north of Miami-Dade sparked renewed optimism that the search for survivors would remain uninterrupted. The NHC said amounts of 3 inches to 5 inches (8 to 13 cm)with localized maximum totals up to 8 inches (20 cm) were expected in the Keys and western portions of Florida through Wednesday, which may result in considerable flash and urban flooding, along with minor to isolated moderate river flooding. A few tornadoes were possible across south Florida on Monday night and across the Florida peninsula on Tuesday, the agency added. ""All Floridians should prepare for the possibility of heavy rain, flooding and potential power outages,"" Florida Governor Ron DeSantis wrote on Twitter. In Seminole, Florida, residents filled sand bags and placed them outside their homes to prevent flooding. ""If we have a lot of water .. and I wait till later to get sand bags there won't be any left, and then I will have a wet bedroom,"" said Wendy Schultz, adding she would stock them anyway for the rest of the season ""'cause, you know, it's Florida."" Authorities and locals in some Caribbean island nations including Cuba had already started work by Monday on repairing damage caused by Elsa such as removing toppled trees and other debris and restoring power.

American defence systems fired rockets into the air in Baghdad, according to AFP reporters, with Iraqi security sources saying the salvos took out a drone that was laden with explosives. Since the start of the year, 47 attacks have targeted US interests in the country, where 2,500 American troops are deployed as part of an international coalition to fight the jihadist Islamic State group. Six of them involved these kinds of drones, a tactic that poses a headache for the coalition as the aircraft can evade air defences. In April, a drone packed with explosives hit the coalition's Iraq headquarters in the military part of the airport in Arbil, the Iraqi Kurdish regional capital. The next month, a drone packed with explosives hit the Ain Al-Asad airbase housing US troops. On June 9, three explosives-laden drones targeted Baghdad airport, where US soldiers are also deployed. One was intercepted by the Iraqi army. In a sign that the United States is concerned about new drone attacks, it recently offered up to $3 million for information on attacks targeting its interests in Iraq. Separately on Monday, three rockets targeted an Iraqi air base in the western desert that also housed US troops, the international anti-jihadist coalition said. The attack targeted the base at Ain al-Assad without causing any casualties.

(Reuters)TOKYO: Japan will consider a one-off cash payout of 100,000 yen ($901.55) to its low-income citizens to ease growing social disparity caused by the coronavirus pandemic, public broadcaster NHK quoted the country's ruling party policy chief as saying. Hakubun Shimomura, the Liberal Democratic Party's policy research council chief, said he would propose the government include the cash payout in a fresh economic package and make it part of the party's pledge for general elections. The general election is due later this year. The comment from the Liberal Democratic Party's heavyweight raises the spectre of another large-scale fiscal stimulus at a time finance minister Taro Aso has voiced concern about the massive debt pile. Shimomura said it would be hard for non-regular workers and single parent families to ride out the pandemic without financial assistance, NHK reported. However, Aso has opposed uniform cash payouts, which he has repeatedly said would leave nothing but a debt pile for the future generations. Economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura left open the possibility of an extra spending plan down the road. ""We have coronavirus emergency reserves left worth 4 trillion yen, so would respond flexibly to take necessary steps with eyes on the economic situation,"" Nishimura told reporters after a cabinet meeting. Japan could craft an extra budget of around 10 trillion yen without issuing additional interest-bearing bonds thanks to tax overshoot from the last fiscal year as well as front-loading the issuance of rollover bonds and sales of treasury bills, said Chotaro Morita, chief bond strategist at SMBC Nikko Securities. Any bigger spending could entail fresh borrowing that would add to the industrial world's heaviest debt at over twice the size of Japan's $5 trillion economy, and would follow a hefty $3 trillion of Covid-19 stimulus deployed over the past year.

The decline coincided with the spread of the Delta variant and the end of social distancing restrictions in Israel.  Vaccine effectiveness in preventing both infection and symptomatic disease fell to 64% since June 6, the Health Ministry said. At the same time the vaccine was 93% effective in preventing hospitalizations and serious illness from the coronavirus.  The ministry in its statement did not say what the previous level was or provide any further details. However ministry officials published a report in May that two doses of Pfizer's vaccine provided more than 95% protection against infection, hospitalization and severe illness.  A Pfizer spokesperson declined to comment on the data from Israel, but cited other research showing that antibodies elicited by the vaccine were still able to neutralize all tested variants, including Delta, albeit at reduced strength.  About 60% of Israel's 9.3 million population have received at least one shot of Pfizer's vaccine in a campaign that saw daily cases drop from more than 10,000 in January to single digits last month.  This spurred Israel to drop nearly all social distancing as well as the requirement to wear masks, though the latter was partially reimposed in recent days. At the same time Delta, which has become a globally dominant variant of the coronavirus, began to spread.  Since then daily cases have gradually risen, reaching 343 on Sunday. The number of seriously ill rose to 35 from 21.  Data scientist Eran Segal of Israel's Weizmann Institute of Science said the country was unlikely to experience the high levels of hospitalizations seen earlier in the year since there were much fewer critically ill.  He said it was fine to ""continue with life back to normal and without restrictions"" while stepping up measures like vaccination outreach and ensuring testing for Israelis returning home from abroad.

Both pilots survived after their Boeing 737 crashed Friday as they were trying to return to the airport in Honolulu. The pilots had reported losing power in one engine and being concerned about the other engine also failing.  The National Transportation Safety Board said investigators planned to use sonar on Monday to survey the debris field where the plane sank so they can recover devices that record information from the plane and capture cockpit sounds. The so-called black boxes can provide vital clues about the cause of a crash.  The safety board said knowing the location, condition and depth of the wreckage will help it determine how to retrieve the records and whether to salvage the plane.  The 46-year-old plane was operated by Rhoades Aviation as Transair Flight 810. It was scheduled to fly from Honolulu to Kahului, Hawaii, but went into the ocean several miles offshore, according to authorities. Both pilots, the only people on board, were seriously injured and were clinging to packages and the tail of the plane when they were rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard, authorities said.  The safety board said it met Saturday with others who will be involved in the investigation, including representatives of the Federal Aviation Administration, Rhoades Aviation, Boeing, engine maker Pratt and Whitney and air traffic controllers.

Five shots were heard Saturday on the Pinetree Country Club in Kennesaw, a city 25 miles (40 kilometers) northwest of Atlanta, according to a witness quoted by local channel WXIA.  When police reached the site, they found the body of one man, later identified as club pro Eugene Siller, on a green. He had been shot in the head, police spokeswoman Shenise Barner told the Atlanta Journal Constitution.  The two men whose bodies were then found in the back of the truck were also gunshot victims, police said.  Authorities did not elaborate on a possible motive.  Nearby Kennesaw State University issued an alert shortly after the shooting, warning of the possible presence of an ""armed and dangerous"" man.  The university later lifted the alert, saying there was ""no credible threat to (the) campus.""  The United States has a long and painful history of deadly gun violence, in the form of a steady daily toll of shootings as well as high-profile mass killings that have targeted schools, work places and shopping centers.

It was only after talking with friends that the 66-year-old retiree from rural Spencer County, Kentucky, was persuaded to get the shot.  ""They said, 'You know, the vaccine may not be 100%, but if you get Covid, you're in bad shape,'"" Rogers said. ""You can die from it.""  With the nation falling just short of President Joe Biden's goal of dispensing at least one shot to 70% of all American adults by the Fourth of July, public health officials in places like Spencer County have shifted the emphasis away from mass vaccination clinics toward getting more information out in a more targeted way about the benefits of getting inoculated.  Health departments have offered the vaccine at concerts, parades and fairs and plan to make it available at back-to-school events. They have encouraged local doctors to raise the issue with patients and promoted shots by way of printed materials and social media.  The hope is that word of mouth will ease fears and misperceptions about the vaccine and change people's minds, one person at a time if necessary.  That's especially important in places like Spencer County, an area of rolling green hills and farmland southeast of Louisville, where the state reports that about 22% of eligible adults are at least partially vaccinated. Public health officials there think the numbers are improving and may already be higher.  Biden administration officials are increasingly turning their attention nationwide to some 55 million unvaccinated adults seen as persuadable, a group they have dubbed the ""movable middle.""  Many of those being targeted are under 30, an age group that has an especially low vaccination rate. But they also include people like Rogers, who said many people in his community are hesitant to get shots because ""they just don't trust the government.""  Rogers, who worked for a packaging supplier in nearby Shelbyville, said he shook off the skepticism and is now looking forward to a summer of ""things going back to normal as they can be.""  Nationally, resistance to getting vaccinated tends to run higher in conservative and rural parts of the country. Overall, 49% of all Kentuckians have received at least one dose, compared with about 55% nationwide.  Stephanie Lokits, who oversees vaccination efforts in the county for the public health department, has watched immunizations slow since a peak in March, when clinics drew hundreds of residents. Now only 10 to 20 trickle through a weekly vaccine clinic held in the county seat of Taylorsville, a town of 1,600 with an old theater, a courthouse, some empty storefronts and a few small businesses slowly finding their way out of the pandemic.  While Kentucky has seen a decline in cases in the past seven weeks, nearly all confirmed infections and deaths reported in the past month have been in unvaccinated residents.  ""I think that the philosophy that we have really tried to go by is that every single shot that we can get administered to a person is a positive thing,"" Lokits said. ""I think that's kind of the place where a lot of health departments and a lot of providers are at.""  Lauren Slone, a nurse practitioner leading the vaccine effort at a community health center in Taylorsville, said she has learned through conversations with her patients that misconceptions about long-term effects pose real problems.  She has found that most people she talks to eventually get vaccinated. The challenge, she said, is ""getting people to talk to me about it in the first place.""  While appointments in the center aren't filling up as quickly as she would like, Slone thinks an effort to distribute information at local middle and high schools led to more vaccine appointments.  ""I thought, you know, one way to get adults in is when teenagers know about it,"" Slone said. ""If your teenager asks to get it, then maybe that encourages you a little bit as well.""  A June drive-thru clinic held after the information push was well-attended by young adults. That's another good sign, Slone said. Only one-third of Kentuckians 18 to 29 have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, compared with 83% of residents 65 and up.  Still, getting the word out can be harder in a rural county, because some residents aren't on social media or don't have consistent access to the internet. And in spread-out, sparsely populated places like Spencer County, some people may not feel the need to get the vaccine as quickly, said district health department director Roanya Rice.  Also, Spencer County has lower cases per-capita than neighboring counties and the state as a whole, meaning the threat can seem far away to some.  Rogers, now fully vaccinated, is enjoying the freedom to take off his mask for good, eat at a restaurant or visit with relatives without worrying.  ""I waited a long time,"" he said. ""I should have gotten it a long time ago.""

The first time she reached number one position was in April 2005 after scoring an unbeaten 91 against New Zealand at the World Cup in Potchefstroom and the difference of more than 16 years at No.1 is the largest for any woman batter. England's Janette Brittin was number one for the first time in 1984 and the last time in 1995, while New Zealand's Debbie Hockley is the only other female batter to have been No.1 more than 10 years apart – first achieving the feat in 1987 and for the final time in 1997. Big-hitting India opener Shafali Verma's scores of 44 and 19 in the last two ODIs of the series saw her gain 49 places to reach 71st position while veteran pacer Jhulan Goswami is up four places to 53rd. In the bowlers' list, all-rounder Deepti Sharma is up one place to 12th after finishing with figures of three for 47 in the final match. For England, opener Lauren Winfield-Hill has advanced 14 places to 41st position with scores of 42 and 36 while Sophia Dunkley has soared 80 places to 76th after scoring 73 not out and 28. Left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone continues her ascent, gaining four places to reach a career-best sixth position among bowlers after returning with figures of three for 33 and two for 36. Kate Cross' haul of five for 34 in the second match of the series has helped her reach 18th position from 25th. Nat Sciver and Sarah Glenn have both moved up one place to reach 22nd and 43rd positions, respectively. In the Women's T20I Player Rankings, Pakistan spinner Nida Dar, who became the first woman from her country to the milestone of a 100 T20I wickets, has gained six spots to reach 15th position after finishing with four wickets in a three-match series against the West Indies. For the West Indies, Shamilia Cornell has moved up 14 slots to 27th place while captain Stafanie Taylor has advanced 10 places to reach 42nd position after claiming a hat-trick and finishing with four for 17 in the last match.

(AP Photo)LONDON: England are set to name an entirely new squad for their upcoming one-day international series against Pakistan after a major Covid-19 outbreak within their camp, the England and Wales Cricket Board announced Tuesday. Tests administered in Bristol on Monday showed three players and four support staff returning positive results, with the rest of the group deemed to be close contacts and having to self-isolate as well. But the ECB have insisted the three-match series against Pakistan, due to start on Thursday, will go ahead. A new squad, to be captained by star all-rounder Ben Stokes, is due to be announced later Tuesday. Stokes, who has been returning to full fitness by playing for county side Durham following a finger injury suffered playing in the Indian Premier League, is now set to make his first England appearance since March. ECB chief executive officer Tom Harrison said: ""We have been mindful that the emergence of the Delta variant, along with our move away from the stringent enforcement of bio-secure environments, could increase the chances of an outbreak. ""We made a strategic choice to try to adapt protocols, in order to support the overall well-being of our players and management staff who have spent much of the last 14 months living in very restricted conditions. ""Overnight we have worked swiftly to identify a new squad, and we are grateful to Ben Stokes who will return to England duties to captain,"" he added. https://t.co/p3SKcSJNN1— England Cricket (@englandcricket) 1625559287000FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailStart a Conversationend of articleCoronavirus outbreakCovaxin vaccineCowin vaccine registrationCoronavirus live newsCorona cases todayCovshield vaccineTrending TopicsCorona cases in IndiaKarnataka governorCoronavirus India update liveMaharashtra assemblyCovid 19Top Stories Right NowindiaAmid Cabinet reshuffle buzz, Union minister Gehlot appointed Karnataka governorindiaLive: Total lockdown in 7 Assam districts from tomorrowhomeTOI's result calculator: Check your Class 12 percentage in 3 stepsMore Latest News. . .

(Photo by Alex Davidson/Getty Images)Confusion grips Indian cricket as board yet to communicate with team over replacementsMUMBAI: In a classic case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing, the BCCI has been busy this last week moving around in circles over a decision that concerns the Indian cricket team. On June 28, the manager of the Indian team Girish Dongre wrote an email to the chairman of selectors Chetan Sharma - as per the Board's own protocol - asking for two replacements in the Indian squad, one as a back-up post Shubman Gill's exit and another batsman. Read AlsoTeam India wants Prithvi Shaw as opener in EnglandPrithvi Shaw, after disappointing tours of New Zealand and Australia, returned home to unleash absolute fury in the Vijay Hazare one-dayers this season, becoming the first ever cricketer to score 800-plus runs in a single edition of the tournament. In doing so, he also broke MS Dhoni and ViratThe replacements have been asked primarily for two reasons: a) In the wake of Gill's injury, the bench has a slot vacant for an opener; b) Another top-order batsman because the Indian team is going to be based out of England for two months and should another unfortunate injury befall, quarantine rules won't allow last minute replacements and travel. It's been a little over a week already and Sharma hasn't responded to the email. TOI asked Sharma if he was in receipt of the email and the former India pacer said, ""you need to speak to the BCCI operations team about it"". There has been no response from the operations team. Read AlsoIs selection committee against sending Prithvi and Padikkal to UK?The Indian team management in England wants young openers Prithvi Shaw and Devdutt Padikkal to join the side but questions are being raised about whether chairman of selectors Chetan Sharma is on the same page as the think-tank.The Indian team is fretting in England, ahead of a series that they are - in ways - aiming for as one of the ""final frontiers"". Those in the know say, ""even if the BCCI doesn't want to send replacements, why not just spell it out. That way, Virat and the rest of the guys can just concentrate on what's at hand"". The BCCI, not really known for its communication, remains unperturbed and hasn't found the time or need to reply to the letter. For the record, the letter sent by the team manager doesn't ask which cricketers need to be sent as replacements. The letter only asks for replacements and the onus solely lies on the national selectors - Sharma and his colleagues -to arrive at a decision. Meanwhile, in Sri Lanka, the Indian team management - overseeing the white-ball series with the island nation - has no idea whether Prithvi Shaw and/or Devdutt Padikkal will be around for the entire series or may have to travel to England. ""Even if they don't have to travel and the BCCI is not considering replacements for England, at least not these two names, then the board can at least convey a clear 'no' on the matter and put an end to it,"" sources say. The BCCI had sent a jumbo squad to Australia in November last year, one that had proved to be a shot in the arm for the team. Despite injuries lining up during the tour, the team management had adequate replacements thanks to the volume of the bench. ""They sent just 24 cricketers to England, of which four are standbys. Abhimanyu Easwaran has done well in First Class cricket but is it fair to make him debut against James Anderson, Jofra Archer and Stuart Broad? KL Rahul is not being considered as an opener but in the middle-order. So, if Gill's injury demands a replacement, and if there's time to fly in one, what's the harm?"" TRIAL BY FIRE? The idea of opening with Abhimanyu Easwaran is disconcertingThe 25-year-old Bengal batsman is clearly a talent to be pursued with. ""But to rush him like this and not giving an ear to what the team is thinking is not a healthy sign,"" sources say. In the end, whether the BCCI wants to look at Team India's requests and cater to them is a call to be taken by the national selectors and the Board secretary, who convenes selection meetings. But not communicating with the Indian team is where the BCCI is getting this wrong right now.

""We must stop watching matches even on TV,"" fumed former great Arjuna Ranatunga, who led Sri Lanka to win the World Cup in 1996 and said the humiliating tour of England was the culmination of years of ""mismanagement, corruption and indiscipline"".

A fifth straight Twenty20 series defeat in England was followed by two one-day international losses with only rain in Monday's final match saving them from a complete tour whitewash. Off the field things were just as bad with three players -- vice-captain Kusal Mendis, opening batsman Danushka Gunathilaka and wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella -- sent home for breaching the team's coronavirus bubble.

""I am sad and angry at the same time,"" Silva, a professor of medicine, said the trio had risked the health of the entire team by breaching the bubble. The team have never been far from scandal and controversy in recent years. Mendis, 26, ran over and killed a 64-year-old cyclist in July last year. He paid one million rupees ($5,000) to the victim's family and was only reprimanded. Gunathilaka, 30, faced match bans in 2018 for violating team curfews on tour. In April, he was ordered to take anger management counselling after a drunken brawl. Read AlsoSri Lanka's 'terrible trio' dropped from Indian seriesThree Sri Lankan cricket players ordered to leave the tour of England on disciplinary grounds will be dropped from a home series against India in July, officials said on Wednesday.Former sports minister Harin Fernando disclosed in November 2019 that the International Cricket Council considered Sri Lanka the most corrupt cricketing nation. Players and officials have been banned for up to eight years for match-fixing and failure to cooperate with corruption investigations. A former team performance analyst, Sanath Jayasundara, was banned for seven years by the ICC on Monday for trying to bribe Fernando. ""What we saw during the England tour is the culmination of accumulated mismanagement, corruption and indiscipline,"" Ranatunga said. ""The board is responsible for this sorry state of affairs."" Ranatunga briefly headed the cricket board in 2008 and has since shown keen interest in returning to manage the game. Little has gone right for Sri Lanka during the past eight years which has seen them go through five coaches. ""I have been watching cricket matches since 1993 but I have never seen such a weak Sri Lankan cricket team,"" sports reporter Manjula Basnayake said. Sri Lanka are languishing at eighth in the Test team rankings and ninth in both white-ball formats with morale believed to have plummeted since the introduction of controversial performance-linked pay contracts which the players rejected. Initiated by Sri Lanka director of cricket Tom Moody, the new contracts saw sharp pay cuts with the board insisting that they were designed to improve rankings. The salary battle is still not resolved and the team will arrive home later Tuesday to prepare for three ODIs and three Twenty20s against India starting on July 13. India have sent a weakened team but with the current state of Sri Lankan cricket, the tourists will still fancy their chances.

In the absence of regular skipper Virat Kohli and the main side, who are currently touring England, Dhawan will lead a second-string Indian team in the series starting July 13.

Speaking to the media here, Lanning said the current system of four-day Tests for women lessens the possibility of an outright result especially if weather plays spoilsport. ""I think it probably makes sense to take it out to five days, we saw in the last two, the Test match we played against England and the one just recently with England and India that there was a little bit of rain around and once that happens, it makes it pretty difficult to to get a result,"" she said. ""So I think pushing out the five days makes a lot of sense and I think you will get more results and then teams pushing for that."" Lanning believes India women playing Test matches abroad is a big advertisement for women's cricket and hoped that her team's upcoming contest against Mithali Raj's side would become a regular feature and not just a ""one-off"" affair. The Indian women's team is currently touring England where they shared honours in the lone Test and won the final match of the three-ODI series. The two sides will now square off in a three-match T20 series starting July 9 at Northampton. After the England sojourn, the Indians will travel to Australia in September to play three ODIs and as many T20Is besides their maiden Day-Night Test at Perth starting September 30. ""It's really exciting that they've (India) agreed to play in a Test match and they're very willing to do it having played England as well,"" Lanning said. ""I think it's only going to move the game forward and increase the awareness of the game both here and in India as well which I think is a really important part of it."" The 29-year-old World Cup-winning Australia skipper personally can't wait to tour India for a Test engagement. ""Personally I'd love to play a Test match in India. I think that would be a great test and a really good challenge and something I'd love to happen in the not too distant future. ""Hopefully, this Test match being part of the series against them is not just a one-off, hopefully, it's the start of something that will continue into the future as well,"" Lanning said. The Indian women last played a Test match against Australia in February 2006 at the Adelaide Oval which the hosts won.

In doing so, he also broke MS Dhoni and ViratHowever, despite being aware of the magnitude of Gill's injury, Sharma is believed to have not paid much heed to team management's requests. It now remains to be seen if they put in a formal request for sending Shaw and Paddikal, to BCCI president Sourav Ganguly and secretary Jay Shah. Shah is also the convenor of the senior selection committee. ""The BCCI president hasn't yet received any formal request about sending Shaw and Padikkal to the United Kingdom.

There were criticisms of Kohli's captaincy following India's defeat toIn fact, had Sharma paid heed to the requisition of the team management from last month, Shaw and Padikkal could have reached England on time for the practice game. When asked what if the team management specifically asks for Shaw, the official said: ""Let them put forth an official mail and then it can be taken forward.

""Look if you haven't picked Prithvi right away then picking him now will send a signal that Easwaran was a wrong selection. That (Easwaran) kid will also end up losing confidence.

Thanks for your support"" - those were Devon Conway's first words to his coach at Wellington Cricket, Glenn Pocknall, over the phone after New Zealand won the inaugural World Test Championship (WTC) title. The Kane Williamson-led side defeated India by eight wickets at the Ageas Bowl in Southampton. Pocknall is glad to see his student Conway going strong. Conway, who is originally from South Africa, moved to New Zealand in 2017 at the age of 26. Conway's long wait of wearing a Test jersey ended at the age of 29, and he made it count in style, becoming only the seventh cricketer overall to reach the 200-run mark in his debut outing. In the second Test, Conway scored 80 runs off 143 balls in the first innings, as New Zealand wrapped up a 1-0 series win vs England. In the WTC final, Conway scored 54 and 19 in New Zealand's win. In the three Tests Conway has played so far, he has scored 379 runs at an average of 63.17, including one double century. TimesofIndia.com caught up with the Wellington Cricket coach Pocknall for an exclusive interview and the New Zealander spoke about various topics, including what went wrong for Virat Kohli's side in the WTC Final, the Virat vs Kane debate and much more. (New Zealand defeated India by eight wickets in the WTC final - Reuters Photo)Excerpts...New Zealand are World Test Champions. How does it feel?It's pretty amazing here. The day after the game we went down to the local indoor center here (Wellington). It's the middle of winter here, so everybody's training indoors. But it was just an absolute buzz with kids here. Everyone wanting to play cricket and wanting to replicate in some ways what Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor did with the bat. So it's going to have a huge impact on cricket and the country, which is great. What a start to his career by Devon Conway, your student. He kicked off his Test career with a majestic 200 and a fifty vs England and then scored another half-century vs India in the WTC final. Did he give you a call after the WTC win? What did he say? ""Coach, we did it. Thank you so much for the support"". That's what he started the conversation with. He was naturally very pleased with what the team had achieved and had to shift focus very quickly, as the day after the final he was traveling to Somerset to get into T20 mode. He has elegance. The whole world has seen it now. He drew attention when he first played a trial game and we just saw him play a cover drive. I and Bruce Edgar, who was the head coach at the time, just had a bit of a glance at each other and just thought to ourselves - ""Well, this is stunning. This guy has got some skills"". That was our first look at the class of Devon Conway and after four years, he did the same on the world stage. It's just testament to how good he is mentally, to be able to adapt to those different conditions. The World Test Championship final was pretty amazing. To see him do that, but it also showed what his character is like and about him being in the right frame of mind mentally, was awesome. New Zealand lost in the finals of the 2015 and 2019 ODI World Cups. The wait for a major ICC trophy was a long one, but Williamson and his men did the job in style, despite rain threatening to rule out a result... Absolutely. I think the amazing thing for all the supporters and fans over here is that it's finally been done, and that is that monkey off the back for the Blackcaps cricket team. And thinking back to 2015, I was watching the game at the MCG, and as I was over there for literally 24 hours to watch the game, and kind of left pretty disheartened after losing to Australia. (New Zealand captain Kane Williamson with the Test Mace - AFP Photo)In 2019, the final, I stayed up all night because of the time zones and it was a fantastic game of cricket; but we obviously came out on the wrong side. So putting those two disappointments I guess in the back of my mind and then seeing how well this team performed over the last couple of years and then culminating with this final against India was absolutely amazing. Ross and Williamson just tried to blunt the Indian attack. By using the word blunt, I mean they just wanted to occupy the crease for as long as they can. They were using the situations so wisely. They were just trying to bide their time and build a partnership and wait for the loose balls to come later and score freely. What went wrong for India in the WTC Final according to you? I think India struggled a little bit to really adjust to the conditions. From a batting perspective and a bowling perspective, I think the batters didn't necessarily show the discipline that the New Zealand batters did. By discipline I mean the ability to leave and the ability to play the ball late. The New Zealand batsman did that very well and occupied the crease for long periods of time, whereas some of the Indians did, but a lot of them failed to do that, which means they couldn't get any meaningful partnerships. From a bowling perspective, I think New Zealand were a little bit more consistent. (Jasprit) Bumrah didn't have the best match. He is such a lynchpin for the (Indian) bowling attack. So not having him at his best was a big factor in India's loss. (A dejected Virat Kohli after the WTC final defeat - AFP Photo)Do you think India should have gone in with a slightly different playing XI? It's very easy to say in hindsight that they should have had another seamer. I am saying that in hindsight because if I guess they knew that the conditions were going to be that seamer-friendly, Jadeja may have missed out. Vihari potentially could have been included, because he performed very well in Australia. But that's in hindsight. Before the match, I would have said that two spinners should have played for India, just because I believe that was the best chance of winning. (Ravindra) Jadeja and (Ravichandran) Ashwin offer so much with the bat too, but I guess it's easy to say after the result that changes should have been made. It's always a challenge for the coach and the captain and the selectors to just go with the gut and make those decisions in the heat of the moment, sometimes. Both Kane and Virat know each other well. They have played against each other since their Under-19 days. What big difference do you see in the two of them as captains? They're both very different people. But they're obviously very close. They've got a very close link because they've had an association for a long period of time. Kane is very, very calm. He doesn't give you much. Virat is very much the opposite. He's very vocal. He's very exuberant. So they both look very different. But I think what they both have is that they're both very passionate and they show their passion in different ways. Virat shows his passion outwardly with his actions and his words. Kane shows his passion just with the chats that he has with his players within the New Zealand cricket team and what they're trying to do in terms of winning a game of cricket. Both are very different but very similar also in the ways that they both have passion for their country and want to lead their team to victory. (File image of Kane Williamson and Virat Kohli - Reuters Photo)Another ICC tournament soon will be the ICC World T20, later this year. How would you rate NZ's chances of winning this World Cup? Who is your favourite? The chances are really high (for a NZ win). There are four other teams, their chances are very high as well. That is the beauty of cricket at the moment. There's no one team dominating any format. You can throw a blanket over five or six of them, and that's pretty exciting for cricket. England and Australia could have easily been in this final series, but they weren't; and the T20 World Cup will be the next. It's going to be a cracker of a World Cup. I personally think India are going into the World Cup as favorites but any team, on any given day, can beat anyone. We've seen in the past the teams going into the World Cups with that favorite tag. So it's going to be another exciting World Cup where any team could go on and win the title. NZ have a very stable T20 side as well. So they'll certainly go in with a lot of confidence to do well at that tournament. Virat missed out on winning his maiden ICC trophy as captain once again. Some people think Virat should give up his captaincy roles and focus just on his batting and that Ajinkya Rahane should be given the Test captaincy and Rohit Sharma the limited-overs role. Your take on that...It's a really good question. It's very hard to answer given the success of the Indian team. Yes, they lost this match (WTC Final). Prior to the WTC final, India were the top-ranked team. Over the two-year period, they played the most consistent cricket. They won the most games. They obviously won that series in Australia, which was a fantastic series to follow. They've had a huge amount of success. So looking at Virat in this one game that they've lost and in contrast with the success he's had as a captain in the championship, I don't think they should (change the captain). I think it would be a bit of a knee-jerk reaction. The only thing that potentially they would be looking at is whether he feels he needs to step down, whether he feels it's too much for him, too much cricket, and it's burning him mentally and burdening the team. I don't think it's from a performance perspective. But whether he feels that, then I guess it's going to be something they need to look at and give somebody else an opportunity. But from New Zealand's perspective, India performed so well over this two-year period, and they've just lost one game of cricket, albeit a very big game of cricket. But it's just one game of cricket. So I guess from my experience of being a fan and going through some of the heartaches of losing World Cup finals, India will come through. I'm sure about this and they're not far away from getting that monkey off their back.

Sri Lanka Cricket said the 29-year-old was in breach of his contract with the interviews to local media and on social media platforms. His ban was suspended for two years, however, and the board said Rajapaksa has been included in a training squad for a series against India starting July 13. The left-hand batsman told interviewers last month that he was unfairly dropped from the just-concluded tour of England where Sri Lanka lost the one-day and T20 series. He played his first T20 against Pakistan in October 2019 and the last in January 2020 against India.

(Photo by Stu Forster/Getty Images for ECB) ISLAMABAD: Pakistan bowling coach Waqar Younis feels it will be tough for paceman Mohammad Amir to make a comeback to international cricket without first impressing domestically. Amir retired from international play last December, saying he was mentally tortured by his teammates and coaches. The left-arm fast bowler played in the recent Pakistan Super League with minimal success. He reportedly met with Pakistan Cricket Board chief executive Wasim Khan earlier this year, leading to speculation of a return before the Twenty20 World Cup in October. ""No doubt he's a fine cricketer, but if he doesn't want to take his retirement back and impress selectors by playing cricket, it will be hard,"" Younis told reporters via videoconference from England on Monday. ""It's Pakistan cricket, it's not yours or my cricket (team), you have to do the right things to play for your country. This is not a franchise cricket and one got to remember that."" Younis said he was not aware about any meeting between Khan and Amir. ""To be honest I didn't know about this (meeting),"" he said. ""He (Khan) is head of the cricket and he has every right to meet whosoever he wants to see; he went there in his personal capacity and we didn't know about it."" Amir played for Karachi Kings in the PSL, but could take only five wickets in 11 matches at an average of 69.80. Karachi was knocked out after losing both of their playoffs. Amir took 259 wickets across 36 Tests, 61 one-day internationals and 50 T20s. He was 18 when he was banned in 2010 for five years and jailed for three months for spot-fixing in a test series in England. He was allowed to return to cricket a few months early and recalled by Pakistan in 2016. In 2019 he no longer wanted to play tests, to focus on white-ball cricket and prolong his international career. Amir's last international was in August 2020 in a T20 against England.

""Article 2.1.3 - offering a bribe or other Reward to the Sri Lankan Sports Minister to contrive in any way or otherwise influence improperly the result, progress, conduct or any other aspect of an International Match. ""Article 2.4.7 - obstructing or delaying an ACU investigation into possible corrupt conduct under the ICC Anti-Corruption Code,"" the statement added. Alex Marshall, ICC General Manager - Integrity Unit, said Jayasundara's actions were disappointing.

It was a Test against India, the fourth and last Test of a four-match series, at the Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai. Hauritz, who was playing under Ricky Ponting's leadership, impressed everyone by claiming five wickets in the match, including the prized scalps of Indian batting legends Sachin Tendulkar and VVS Laxman. Interestingly, Hauritz also played his career's last Test match against India and managed to send MS Dhoni and Cheteshwar Pujara back to the hut at the M. Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengaluru. Hauritz has fond memories of his debut match and the Indian crowd and also visiting one of the seven wonders in the world - the Taj Mahal in Agra. TimesofIndia.com caught up with the former Australian cricketer, who played 17 Tests, 58 ODIs and 3 T20Is from 2004 to 2011 to talk about India's WTC performance, Virat Kohli the captain, India's two back-to-back Test series wins in Australia, life post retirement, being in Brisbane which is under lockdown and much more. (Nathan Hauritz played the first and last Test of his career against India - Twitter Photo)Excerpts... What has life been like post-retirement? We are in Brisbane in the middle of the lockdown. We have been very lucky and blessed in terms of what is happening all around the world. I have been playing a little bit of cricket and coaching as well. I am currently involved in full-time coaching in an academy in Brisbane. I am really busy on the coaching front. The last couple of days have been relaxing for me. I am just catching my breath and rejuvenating myself before the season starts. What went wrong for India in the WTC final, according to you?Indian batters didn't use the conditions well. They failed to judge the conditions. India's middle-order is not firing at the moment. That was the reason. A lot was on Virat's shoulder and he knows that. The decision of playing two spinners in England, in the place that was raining, that was a very unusual decision. Better to have taken a chance with seamers. I think Siraj would have made a difference. He did well in Australia and his inclusion would have been great. (New Zealand defeated India by eight wickets in the World Test Championship final - Reuters Photo)Will this WTC final defeat have any impact on Virat's men ahead of the England Test series, you think?I don't think so. You are playing at such a level when you are mentally strong and leave bad things behind and move on. It's really important that you move on pretty quickly, have a look at everything, see what's going on and make improvements where needed. You can't really focus on what's happened, you've got to keep moving forward and keep focusing on the next game. You made your Test debut against India and played your last Test against India. Your favourite cricketing memory...For me, my favorite moment would have been just playing my debut Test against India. Getting Tendulkar out in my first Test was incredible. I loved the Indian people, the crowd, the fans, the buzz around. It was such an amazing environment to be part of. On a travelling note, going to the Taj Mahal was simply amazing. (VVS Laxman, left, and MS Dhoni - TOI Photo)You have played against former India captains Rahul Dravid and MS Dhoni. Now, Virat is leading the side. What big difference do you see in the captaincy styles of Virat vis a vis Dravid and Dhoni?Virat Kohli is very passionate. You can definitely see that in his game and he wants to win every game. Both Rahul Dravid and Dhoni were very calm while captaining. The difference I reckon between the sides is that the (current) team is rebuilding. Look, back in the day you had Dravid, Tendulkar, Laxman, Dhoni, (Sourav) Ganguly, (Virender) Sehwag and (Gautam) Gambhir. That was an incredibly strong batting lineup. Whereas this one now is a very young side that's rebuilding and it's something they got to make sure that they keep building from here. Would you compare Virat the captain with say someone like Ricky Ponting?It's pretty hard to compare. Virat's passion is second to none in the world. Ricky Ponting was a passionate player as well. Both showed their passion in a different way. And the way they approach the game, Virat is probably one of the best batsmen to have ever played the game. He's been a fantastic leader. The WTC final didn't go the way he would have liked. But it was affected by rain. So I think it's just really important to stay true to himself and what the team needs to work on and he needs to pass that message on and be accountable as a leader. (Virat Kohli leads the Indian team off the ground after losing the WTC Final against New Zealand - PTI Photo)India won back-to-back Test series in Australia. Have they shed the tag of bad travellers now?I think that stigma is always going to be there for the side that hasn't travelled well. It's going to be tough to break. They played well against Australia and got some really key moments. And look in Australia predominantly, they're very hard to beat on their own soil. But I think the Indian side, at the moment, has been performing well enough to justify probably getting rid of that tag. The Virat-led Indian team won their maiden Border-Gavaskar series against Australia who were without Steve Smith and David Warner. In the series after that India lost the Adelaide Test and went on to win the Test series under Ajinkya Rahane's leadership. Which India triumph would you rate as the better one?Virat had been a fantastic leader. He went away and Rahane did really well and took India to a win. It's very hard to choose one or the other all the time. You've got to back the leader, and like he (Virat) is doing his best job. And as I said earlier, it's not just the leader, it's the whole group. It's part of their team and just got to find ways to improve each day. Just get that little bit better each day.

(AFP Photo)SYDNEY: Missing out on the World Test Championship final was a ""bitter pill to swallow"", said a frustrated Australia red-ball skipper Tim Paine, who enjoined the match referees to be more consistent while imposing points penalty for slow over rates. New Zealand were crowned Test champions after notching up an eight-victory over India in Southampton last month. Australia, who were front runners in the race to reach the WTC final, were docked four points for slow over rate during the Boxing Day Test against India. The series was Paine and company's last chance to earn WTC points after their tour of South Africa was postponed. However, India had a home series against England to earn points and Virat Kohli and his men did enough to book a spot alongside New Zealand in the WTC final. ""Bitterly disappointed that we weren't there (WTC final) because of over rates,"" Paine told reporters. ""We've always got things in place to try to help out with that, but unfortunately it doesn't always work. Unfortunately, we're the team that I think has borne the brunt of it for an over rate."" Paine called for more consistency while handing out points penalties. ""There's been a lot of Test match cricket in the last two years where teams haven't bowled their overs and I'm not sure how many teams lost points out of it. ""I think there needs to be a little bit more consistency around it, given now that the prize is so big and a couple of overs can cost you four points. The wicketkeeper-batsman suggested that Australia was the only team to be docked points for an over rate offence. ""We were behind on our overs, and that's what it is. My thing is just with consistency. I haven't played in too many days where the full overs have been bowled, and to my knowledge there haven't been other teams docked points. ""Yeah, it's a bitter pill to swallow when you're the only team that's been docked points and you see it happen Test match after Test match, after Test match."" The 36-year-old revealed it was difficult for him to watch the summit clash between India and New Zealand. ""I didn't watch too much of it. I watched the last day. I turned it on excited to watch the first day. I thought I was excited, and then got a bit dirty and didn't watch it."" ""I tuned in for the last day and it was bloody exciting, it was great cricket to watch.""

SLC sources said the players are returning from the UK on Tuesday and they will be served with an July 8 deadline to sign the contracts. Anyone failing to do so would be excluded from selection for the home series against India starting July 13. The two sides declared a temporary truce with players agreeing to sign a tour contract to undertake the tour of England last month. The disastrous tour ended with defeats in both formats and was further slipped into controversy with three leading players sent back for violating the bio bubble. Meanwhile, the desperate selectors have decided to bring back the left handed batsman Bhanuka Rajapaksa into the team having fined him USD 5000 and handing him a two year suspended ban for breaching contract terms. Rajapaksa had been highly critical of the management's fitness requirement regime for players. Prior to the England tour, the players defied a June 3 deadline to sign the contracts citing lack of transparency in the process. While defying the deadline, the players said that at all times they were willing to play for the country even if the administration decided not to pay salaries due to them refusing to enter contracts. At the height of the dispute and negotiations during May, the players said remuneration proposed to players were more than three fold lower than payments made to players of other counties according to information received from the Federation of International Cricket Association (FICA). Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) had by then announced that 24 of the leading players had been offered contracts under 4 categories and they had been given a deadline until June 3 to sign them. In the categories released only six players are in the category A and their annual pay ranges between USD 70,000 to 100,000. The batsman, Dhananjaya de Silva drew the highest - with the rest of them were to receive USD 70-80,000. The players then took exception to the decision by the SLC to make public payment details of players. They claimed that the SLC decision to make public pay details of players had affected their self-confidence and peace of mind.

(TOI Photo)NEW DELHI: There is no reason to remove Ravi Shastri from Indian cricket team's head coach's position if he continues to produce results, feels legendary former captain Kapil Dev. The 59-year-old Shastri's contract comes to an end after the completion of T20 World Cup in the United Arab Emirates in October-November and it will also depend on whether the former India all-rounder is in a mood to re-apply. Speculations have been rife that BCCI may elevate current NCA head Rahul Dravid as coach for the limited over series in Sri Lanka but as of now it looks highly improbable. ""I don't think there is any need to speak about it. Let this Sri Lanka series get over. We'll get to know the kind of performance our team has dished out,"" Kapil told 'ABP News'. ""If you're trying to groom a new coach, there's nothing wrong with it. Then again, if Ravi Shastri continues to do a good job, there's no reason to remove him either. Only time will tell. Before that, I think it will put unnecessary pressure on our coaches and players,"" Kapil said about his former vice-captain. Shastri has guided the Indian team to Test series wins in Australia twice. Under him, India also reached the semi-final of the 2019 World Cup and the WTC Final but went down to New Zealand in both the knockout games. Two Indians teams are set to play in two different countries with Virat Kohli and his men gearing up for the five-Test series in England, while a Shikhar Dhawan-led team will take on hosts Sri Lanka in a limited over series. Kapil said: ""Indian team has big bench strength. If players get the opportunity and India can assemble two teams that can claim to win in both England and Sri Lanka, there is nothing better."" Kapil is happy that a lot of talented youngsters have gotten opportunities for the Sri Lanka series. ""If the youngsters get the opportunity, there's nothing wrong with it. But if it is up to the team management to decide whether they should apply such pressure on two teams simultaneously,"" Kapil pointed out.

Tests administered in Bristol on Monday showed three players and four support staff returning positive results, with the rest of the group deemed to be close contacts and having to self-isolate as well. But the ECB have insisted the three-match series against Pakistan, due to start on Thursday, will go ahead. A new squad, to be captained by star all-rounder Ben Stokes, is due to be announced later Tuesday. Stokes, who has been returning to full fitness by playing for county side Durham following a finger injury suffered playing in the Indian Premier League, is now set to make his first England appearance since March. ECB chief executive officer Tom Harrison said: ""We have been mindful that the emergence of the Delta variant, along with our move away from the stringent enforcement of bio-secure environments, could increase the chances of an outbreak. ""We made a strategic choice to try to adapt protocols, in order to support the overall well-being of our players and management staff who have spent much of the last 14 months living in very restricted conditions. ""Overnight we have worked swiftly to identify a new squad, and we are grateful to Ben Stokes who will return to England duties to captain,"" he added. https://t.co/p3SKcSJNN1— England Cricket (@englandcricket) 1625559287000FacebookTwitterLinkedinEMailStart a Conversationend of articleCoronavirus outbreakCovaxin vaccineCowin vaccine registrationCoronavirus live newsCorona cases todayCovshield vaccineTrending TopicsCorona cases in IndiaKarnataka governorCoronavirus India update liveMaharashtra assemblyCovid 19Top Stories Right NowindiaAmid Cabinet reshuffle buzz, Union minister Gehlot appointed Karnataka governorindiaLive: Total lockdown in 7 Assam districts from tomorrowhomeTOI's result calculator: Check your Class 12 percentage in 3 stepsMore Latest News. . .

PV Sindhu's badminton silver and Sakshi Malik's bronze in wrestling added to the contribution of women in India's Olympic history, since former weightlifter Karnam Malleswari's bronze broke the glass ceiling at Sydney in 2000. Aditi Ashok, India's lone golfer in the women's field at the Tokyo Olympics, wants to take inspiration from Sakshi and Sindhu's feats in Rio. ""The women did well in Rio and that is a motivating factor for me to do well this time in Tokyo,"" said Aditi, in her opening comment while replying to TimesofIndia.com from the US.

To have the honour of playing for India @OlympicGolf… https://t.co/Mo8V1RAeTZ— Aditi Ashok (@aditigolf) 1624974288000Aditi booked a ticket to Tokyo after she was placed world No. 45 among the top 60 golfers. The 23-year-old wants to use this opportunity to the fullest, so that it earns more recognition for golf in the country. ""I think being a woman golfer at the Olympics is a great way to make the game popular to the masses, said Aditi, who plays on the LPGA and LET tours since turning professional in 2016. ""Golf isn’t as popular in India, so playing on the world's biggest stage will definitely help the growth of the sport."" At Rio, she was just 18 and the youngest in the field there; and the Bengaluru girl is quick to make a point about what she learnt from the Games five years ago. ""The experience at Rio in general remains at the back of my mind,"" Aditi told TimesofIndia.com, before adding a note about her experience as a professional golfer. ""The experience of playing on LPGA (tour) for the last five years is invaluable and I think playing more tournaments has always helped my performance historically. So definitely playing on LPGA before the Olympics will help me get into the groove,"" said the 23 year old, who won the Ladies British Amateur Stroke Play Championship in 2015 before stepping onto the professional greens. (At the Rio Olympics, the then 18-year-old Aditi was the youngest in the women's field - Photo by Scott Halleran/Getty Images)Another significant factor coming to Aditi's aid in Tokyo could be the experience of playing amid the Covid-19 restrictions in place. The number of cases in Tokyo has been rising again with just over two weeks before the Olympics. It may lead to stricter pandemic protocols, restricting the movement of athletes further. Aditi said she is well versed with it now. ""I have played in at least 10-15 tournaments with Covid restrictions, so I’m used to it by now and know how to manage myself,"" said Aditi, who shot to fame by winning the 2016 Hero Women's Indian Open. .

In our countdown to the Tokyo Olympics we are regularly profiling some of the biggest medal contenders at the upcoming quadrennial event. One team which is expected to do well at the Games this time is the Indian Men's hockey team. Hockey has traditionally been India's best sport at the Olympics, yielding as many as 11 medals from 1928 to 1980. These include as many as 8 gold medals, 1 silver and 2 bronze medals. However, it has been a long time since India won a hockey medal at the Olympics. The last time was in the 1980 Moscow Games, when the Men's team won the gold. Can the current Men's team break the 40 year jinx this time? Indian Men's Hockey team (current)Major achievements:* Bronze in 2018 Jakarta Asian Games * Silver in 2018 Breda Champions Trophy * Gold in 2018 Muscat Asian Champions Trophy * Gold in 2017 Dhaka Asia Cup * Bronze in 2016-17 Bhubaneswar World League * Silver in 2016 London Champions Trophy * Silver in 2016 Guwahati South Asian Games * Bronze in 2014-15 Raipur World League * Gold in 2014 Incheon Asian Games * Silver in 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games * Silver in 2013 Ipoh Asia Cup * Gold in 2011 Ordos City Asian Champions Trophy Manpreet Singh. Pic credit: Hockey India TwitterIndia were once a force to be reckoned with in men's hockey having won as many as eight gold medals at the Olympic Games. In fact, the last time the Games were held in Japan, in 1964, India won the gold medal. But after the gold in the 1980 edition, the wait for the next Men's hockey medal at the Olympics has been a very long one. At Tokyo 2020, the 16-member Indian team will be led by mid-fielder Manpreet Singh, who was the first Indian hockey player to be named the FIH men's hockey player of the year - in 2019. The Indian team has done well under Manpreet's captaincy over the past four years, having won the Asia Cup in 2017, the Asian Champions Trophy in 2018 and the FIH Series Final in 2019. They also reached the quarterfinals in the 2018 World Cup in Bhubaneswar. This will be Manpreet's third Olympic Games and he will have two deputies in defenders Birendra Lakra and Harmanpreet Singh. Harmanpreet made his senior India debut in 2015 and in the absence of skipper Manpreet in 2019, led the Indian team to a win at the FIH Olympic Test event in Tokyo. But the most interesting fact about this Indian squad is that out of the 16 players, as many as 10 players are going to feature in their maiden Olympics. These 10 players are: Amit Rohidas, Hardik Singh, Vivek Sagar Prasad, Nilakanta Sharma, Sumit, Shamsher Singh, Dilpreet Singh, Gurjant Singh, Lalit Kumar Upadhyay and Birendra Lakra. Birendra Lakra had missed the 2016 Rio Olympics due to a knee surgery. The Indian players would look to learn from the experience of defenders Rupinder Pal Singh and Surender Kumar and forward Mandeep Singh, who were also a part of the previous Indian Olympic squad in Rio de Janeiro in 2016.

Pic credit: Hockey India TwitterKrishan Bahadur Pathak missed out on an Olympic berth despite being an integral part of the team and former skipper PR Sreejesh is the lone goalkeeper in the squad. However Pathak will travel with the squad to Tokyo as the stand-by goal-keeper. India have been clubbed alongside defending champions Argentina, three-time world champions and current world no.1 Australia, New Zealand, Spain and hosts Japan in Pool A. India will begin their Olympic campaign on July 24 against New Zealand in their first Pool stage match.

(AP Photo)It's a match between teams who have almost forgotten what it feels like to loseLONDON: Luis Enrique thought for a couple of seconds, looked straight back at the questioner, and gave the curtest of replies. ""No,"" said the Spain coach, with the blankest of looks on his face, after being asked if he had seen a better team than his at the European Championship. An answer out of blind loyalty? Perhaps. Or was it the fact that Spain is the leading scorer at Euro 2020? Maybe. Or the fact that La Roja is on an unbeaten streak stretching back to October, a run of 13 games? Quite possibly. Spain's opponent in the European Championship semifinals on Tuesday might have something to say about all that. Italy, another of the continent's traditional powers, brings an even better run of form to Wembley Stadium -- a national-record 32 matches unbeaten, going all the way back to September 2018. From the moment tenor Andrea Bocelli cleared the field at Stadio Olimpico after his stirring rendition of ""Nessun Dorma"" at the opening ceremony, making way for the start of the tournament, the Italians have been right on the money. Three impressive wins in the group stage, without conceding. A gutsy victory over a better-than-expected Austria in the round of 16. The elimination of top-ranked Belgium in the quarterfinals. Maybe Luis Enrique isn't aware, but Italy is rolling at the moment. This might be a match between teams who have almost forgotten what it feels like to lose -- Spain has only one defeat in its last 29 games -- but Italy looks to have the edge, at both ends of the field. Much has changed since Roberto Mancini took charge in May 2018, with the team having evolved into a high-energy unit that presses hard and attacks at pace. But the Azzurri's defense needs little introduction. Formidable center backs Leonardo Bonucci and Giorgio Chiellini are still holding the fort, like they have been for more than a decade, and Italy has conceded only two goals so far. Spain's defense, on the other hand, is a work in progress while center back Aymeric Laporte integrates following his switch of nationality from France. In attack, striker Alvaro Morata continues to frustrate for Spain, which needed a penalty shootout to get past Switzerland in the round of 16, and Luis Enrique has seemingly yet to settle on his preferred wingers. Italy, though, has had strong and reliable performances from striker Ciro Immobile and wide forward Lorenzo Insigne, the scorer of the decisive second goal against Belgium. It's in midfield where Spain can seriously challenge Italy, potentially making it the department where the match could be won or lost. Jorginho, Nicola Barella and probably Marco Verratti for Italy versus Sergio Busquets, Pedri Gonzalez and Koke for Spain is a must-watch duel all by itself. Neither team has made it this far in a major international competition since 2012, when they met in the European Championship final in Kyiv. Spain won that match 4-0. Two players remain from each country: Bonucci and Chiellini for Italy, and Jordi Alba and Busquets for Spain. So while this is far from uncharted territory for two countries with nine European Championship or World Cup titles between them, it is for most of the players involved. Expect the Spanish to have the majority of possession, but maybe by not as much as they are accustomed. And expect the Italians to launch quick counterattacks from turnover balls, seeking to get behind the aging Busquets and attack the soft center of Spain's defense. ""It's a style of football that Spain has played over the last 15-20 years and has brought incredible success,"" Mancini said Monday through a translator. ""Our style of play is slightly different. We are Italy. We can't necessarily become Spanish overnight. We have our own way of playing and we'll try to be true to that."" Mancini said striker Andrea Bellotti and defender Rafael Toloi should be available after what he described as ""knocks."" With Leonardo Spinazzola out with a serious Achilles tendon injury, Emerson Palmieri is set to fill in at left back. Spain will be without winger Pablo Sarabia, who hurt his thigh against Switzerland, but Luis Enrique said Laporte will be available despite missing training on Sunday as he recovers from playing all of the team's games so far. A win for Spain, which has the youngest squad at the tournament, sets up the prospect of a third European Championship title in four editions and potentially the start of new period of success for a nation that dominated world soccer from 2008-12. A win for Italy surely means Mancini's team would enter the final as the favorite, no matter who wins the second semifinal match between England and Denmark.

The first time she reached number one position was in April 2005 after scoring an unbeaten 91 against New Zealand at the World Cup in Potchefstroom and the difference of more than 16 years at No.1 is the largest for any woman batter. England's Janette Brittin was number one for the first time in 1984 and the last time in 1995, while New Zealand's Debbie Hockley is the only other female batter to have been No.1 more than 10 years apart – first achieving the feat in 1987 and for the final time in 1997. Big-hitting India opener Shafali Verma's scores of 44 and 19 in the last two ODIs of the series saw her gain 49 places to reach 71st position while veteran pacer Jhulan Goswami is up four places to 53rd. In the bowlers' list, all-rounder Deepti Sharma is up one place to 12th after finishing with figures of three for 47 in the final match. For England, opener Lauren Winfield-Hill has advanced 14 places to 41st position with scores of 42 and 36 while Sophia Dunkley has soared 80 places to 76th after scoring 73 not out and 28. Left-arm spinner Sophie Ecclestone continues her ascent, gaining four places to reach a career-best sixth position among bowlers after returning with figures of three for 33 and two for 36. Kate Cross' haul of five for 34 in the second match of the series has helped her reach 18th position from 25th. Nat Sciver and Sarah Glenn have both moved up one place to reach 22nd and 43rd positions, respectively. In the Women's T20I Player Rankings, Pakistan spinner Nida Dar, who became the first woman from her country to the milestone of a 100 T20I wickets, has gained six spots to reach 15th position after finishing with four wickets in a three-match series against the West Indies. For the West Indies, Shamilia Cornell has moved up 14 slots to 27th place while captain Stafanie Taylor has advanced 10 places to reach 42nd position after claiming a hat-trick and finishing with four for 17 in the last match.

It's not just the record number of shooting athletes that India will send to Tokyo, but the ""diversity"" of it that Abhinav Bindra also finds unique and unmatched -- something that may lead to historic Games for Indian shooting.

""It is absolutely wonderful to see this diversity in sport because the Olympic Games really stand for diversity...Of course, the Indian shooting team (for Tokyo Olympics) also really embodies this uniqueness because we have very young athletes; we have athletes who've been in the sport for many, many years; we have athletes who are towards the latter end of their career, some are just starting out their career.

(Photo by Alex Davidson/Getty Images)Confusion grips Indian cricket as board yet to communicate with team over replacementsMUMBAI: In a classic case of the left hand not knowing what the right hand is doing, the BCCI has been busy this last week moving around in circles over a decision that concerns the Indian cricket team. On June 28, the manager of the Indian team Girish Dongre wrote an email to the chairman of selectors Chetan Sharma - as per the Board's own protocol - asking for two replacements in the Indian squad, one as a back-up post Shubman Gill's exit and another batsman. Read AlsoTeam India wants Prithvi Shaw as opener in EnglandPrithvi Shaw, after disappointing tours of New Zealand and Australia, returned home to unleash absolute fury in the Vijay Hazare one-dayers this season, becoming the first ever cricketer to score 800-plus runs in a single edition of the tournament. In doing so, he also broke MS Dhoni and ViratThe replacements have been asked primarily for two reasons: a) In the wake of Gill's injury, the bench has a slot vacant for an opener; b) Another top-order batsman because the Indian team is going to be based out of England for two months and should another unfortunate injury befall, quarantine rules won't allow last minute replacements and travel. It's been a little over a week already and Sharma hasn't responded to the email. TOI asked Sharma if he was in receipt of the email and the former India pacer said, ""you need to speak to the BCCI operations team about it"". There has been no response from the operations team. Read AlsoIs selection committee against sending Prithvi and Padikkal to UK?The Indian team management in England wants young openers Prithvi Shaw and Devdutt Padikkal to join the side but questions are being raised about whether chairman of selectors Chetan Sharma is on the same page as the think-tank.The Indian team is fretting in England, ahead of a series that they are - in ways - aiming for as one of the ""final frontiers"". Those in the know say, ""even if the BCCI doesn't want to send replacements, why not just spell it out. That way, Virat and the rest of the guys can just concentrate on what's at hand"". The BCCI, not really known for its communication, remains unperturbed and hasn't found the time or need to reply to the letter. For the record, the letter sent by the team manager doesn't ask which cricketers need to be sent as replacements. The letter only asks for replacements and the onus solely lies on the national selectors - Sharma and his colleagues -to arrive at a decision. Meanwhile, in Sri Lanka, the Indian team management - overseeing the white-ball series with the island nation - has no idea whether Prithvi Shaw and/or Devdutt Padikkal will be around for the entire series or may have to travel to England. ""Even if they don't have to travel and the BCCI is not considering replacements for England, at least not these two names, then the board can at least convey a clear 'no' on the matter and put an end to it,"" sources say. The BCCI had sent a jumbo squad to Australia in November last year, one that had proved to be a shot in the arm for the team. Despite injuries lining up during the tour, the team management had adequate replacements thanks to the volume of the bench. ""They sent just 24 cricketers to England, of which four are standbys. Abhimanyu Easwaran has done well in First Class cricket but is it fair to make him debut against James Anderson, Jofra Archer and Stuart Broad? KL Rahul is not being considered as an opener but in the middle-order. So, if Gill's injury demands a replacement, and if there's time to fly in one, what's the harm?"" TRIAL BY FIRE? The idea of opening with Abhimanyu Easwaran is disconcertingThe 25-year-old Bengal batsman is clearly a talent to be pursued with. ""But to rush him like this and not giving an ear to what the team is thinking is not a healthy sign,"" sources say. In the end, whether the BCCI wants to look at Team India's requests and cater to them is a call to be taken by the national selectors and the Board secretary, who convenes selection meetings. But not communicating with the Indian team is where the BCCI is getting this wrong right now.

""We must stop watching matches even on TV,"" fumed former great Arjuna Ranatunga, who led Sri Lanka to win the World Cup in 1996 and said the humiliating tour of England was the culmination of years of ""mismanagement, corruption and indiscipline"". Now it seems Sri Lankan fans have had enough of the under-performing players they usually treat like demi-gods. A fifth straight Twenty20 series defeat in England was followed by two one-day international losses with only rain in Monday's final match saving them from a complete tour whitewash. Off the field things were just as bad with three players -- vice-captain Kusal Mendis, opening batsman Danushka Gunathilaka and wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella -- sent home for breaching the team's coronavirus bubble. They were dubbed the ""terrible trio"" by Sri Lankan media after videos surfaced on social media showing them on a night out in Durham on the eve of a one-day game. Read AlsoSri Lanka cricketers suspended for bio-bubble breach in EnglandSri Lanka Cricket (SLC) on Monday suspended three players, including batsman Kusal Mendis and wicketkeeper Niroshan Dickwella, for breaching the bio-bubble during their ongoing tour of England and ordered their immediate return to the country.Prior to that thousands of fans had already launched a campaign to boycott players on social media after they were swept 3-0 in the Twenty20s. ""The board spent 69 million rupees ($345,000) to fly them in a chartered aircraft to keep them within a protected bio-secure bubble,"" said former Sri Lanka Cricket president Arjun Silva. ""I am sad and angry at the same time,"" Silva, a professor of medicine, said the trio had risked the health of the entire team by breaching the bubble. The team have never been far from scandal and controversy in recent years. Mendis, 26, ran over and killed a 64-year-old cyclist in July last year. He paid one million rupees ($5,000) to the victim's family and was only reprimanded. Gunathilaka, 30, faced match bans in 2018 for violating team curfews on tour. In April, he was ordered to take anger management counselling after a drunken brawl. Read AlsoSri Lanka's 'terrible trio' dropped from Indian seriesThree Sri Lankan cricket players ordered to leave the tour of England on disciplinary grounds will be dropped from a home series against India in July, officials said on Wednesday.Former sports minister Harin Fernando disclosed in November 2019 that the International Cricket Council considered Sri Lanka the most corrupt cricketing nation. Players and officials have been banned for up to eight years for match-fixing and failure to cooperate with corruption investigations. A former team performance analyst, Sanath Jayasundara, was banned for seven years by the ICC on Monday for trying to bribe Fernando. ""What we saw during the England tour is the culmination of accumulated mismanagement, corruption and indiscipline,"" Ranatunga said. ""The board is responsible for this sorry state of affairs."" Ranatunga briefly headed the cricket board in 2008 and has since shown keen interest in returning to manage the game. Little has gone right for Sri Lanka during the past eight years which has seen them go through five coaches. ""I have been watching cricket matches since 1993 but I have never seen such a weak Sri Lankan cricket team,"" sports reporter Manjula Basnayake said. Sri Lanka are languishing at eighth in the Test team rankings and ninth in both white-ball formats with morale believed to have plummeted since the introduction of controversial performance-linked pay contracts which the players rejected. Initiated by Sri Lanka director of cricket Tom Moody, the new contracts saw sharp pay cuts with the board insisting that they were designed to improve rankings. The salary battle is still not resolved and the team will arrive home later Tuesday to prepare for three ODIs and three Twenty20s against India starting on July 13. India have sent a weakened team but with the current state of Sri Lankan cricket, the tourists will still fancy their chances.

Events at large venues and night events after 9 p.m. would also be held without spectators, while the number of VIPs such as sponsors' guests and diplomats at the opening ceremony would be reduced sharply from an initial estimate of about 10,000, the paper said, citing multiple unidentified government sources. Already delayed by a year because of the coronavirus pandemic, the Games are set to open on July 23 amid concern that the influx of tens of thousands of people from around the world could unleash another wave of infections in the country. Organisers of the Games have already banned spectators from overseas and set a cap on domestic spectators at 10,000 per venue for the Games, or 50% of capacity, despite medical experts' view that no spectators would be the “least risky” option. Japan's government, however, looks likely to decide on Thursday to extend a state of quasi-emergency in Tokyo and three nearby prefectures beyond an original end-date of July 11, a move which will require a rethink on spectators as well.

Suga was keen to have fans in the stadiums, the Asahi said, but added some ruling party members favour a complete ban, especially after the ruling coalition failed to win a majority in Sunday's election for the Tokyo local assembly, partly due to voters' dissatisfaction with the government's Covid-19 response.

Hence, spare a thought for Italian Lorenzo Sonego, who, on his Centre Court debut, found himself a break point down at 5-5 in the first set of his fourth-round showdown with Roger Federer when a cloudburst sent the players scurrying back to the locker room. One can only guess the torment he must have endured during Monday's 20-minute stoppage, during which the roof was closed over the soggy and windswept court, but upon resumption it was clear the disruption had done Sonego no favours. He immediately produced a double fault under the floodlights to surrender his serve and that was the break Federer needed to prove that when it comes to Wimbledon, he is no pushover, even at the grand old age of 39. Straight sets, straight into his 18th #Wimbledon quarter-final... @rogerfederer beats Lorenzo Sonego 7-5, 6-4, 6-… https://t.co/JIaaCDByda— Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) 1625512456000The eight-time champion weathered a first-set storm, from his opponent and the rain gods, to become the oldest man in the Open Era to reach the Wimbledon quarter-finals with a 7-5, 6-4, 6-2 win over the 23rd seed. ""It's just amazing the difference an indoor and an outdoor situation can do,"" Federer, who turns 40 next month, said after advancing to the last eight at the All England Club for a record-extending 18th time. ""It was tricky conditions and after the first set I felt I controlled the match better. I couldn't be more excited to be in the quarters,"" Sonego is certainly no slouch on green turf having won his first ATP title on the surface in Turkey two years ago and he seemed to relish the challenge of facing the man who has no equal when it comes to grasscourt tennis. Maybe it was the gusting wind or Federer's lack of match-practice, after playing only a handful of tournaments in the past 18 months, but the sixth seed let break point after break point slip through his fingers in the opening set. Even when a Sonego forehand error handed him a 4-3 lead, the Swiss could not hold on to it when he went to serve for the set at 5-4 up. 18 Wimbledon quarter-finals...No place like home, @rogerfederer.#Wimbledon— Wimbledon (@Wimbledon) 1625532180000PLUCKY ITALIANThe plucky Italian earned a standing ovation when he conjured a show-stopping lob over a leaping Federer en route to breaking Wimbledon's favourite son to love to draw level at 5-5. Then followed the game that featured 20 points, seven deuces, a poor Federer lob that was smashed away by Sonego and some electrifying rat-a-tat exchanges at the net before rain rudely stopped the players in their stride. When the players returned to resume the game that had already dragged on for 12 minutes in actual court-time, it took 15 seconds to see whose nerves had been shot to pieces. That provided Federer with the spark he needed to motor through the rest of the contest after converting only two of the nine break points he had earned during the first set. ""When you're me, with the year I had, it's all question marks all over the place. You have to prove it again to yourself that you can actually do it,"" said Federer, who underwent two knee surgeries in 2020. ""Now we'll see how much more I've got left in the tank. Clearly it was important again to win in straight sets."" In his record-extending 58th quarter-final at a major, the 20-time Grand Slam champion will meet either Russian second seed Daniil Medvedev or Poland's Hubert Hurkacz, whose match will resume on Tuesday.

Manager Gareth Southgate has been able to regularly change his team, with a plethora of attacking talent at his disposal. Here, AFP Sport takes a look at five England players who could make an impact off the bench if not named in the starting line-up: -- Aston Villa forward Jack Grealish has impressed during the tournament despite seeing limited game-time. The 25-year-old, who has been linked with a move to Manchester City, set up Raheem Sterling's winner on his only start in the final group game against the Czech Republic. ""This is what I was born to do. I can't wait,"" he said before the last-16 match against Germany, when he came off the bench to claim another assist, this time for Harry Kane.

England topped their group and beat old foes Germany in the round of 16 before ratcheting upHe did not feature in the quarterfinal thrashing of Ukraine at the Stadio Olimpico, so will be fresh if called upon by Southgate this week. -- The 21-year-old Phil Foden enjoyed a stellar season for Manchester City, scoring 16 goals in all competitions as Pep Guardiola's men won the Premier League and reached the Champions League final. Foden was widely tipped to be one of the stars of Euro 2021, but after starting England's opening two matches, has not played since. -- When England were struggling to create chances during the group stage, Southgate was criticised by pundits and supporters for not giving a chance to Jadon Sancho, who made only one late substitute appearance across the first four games. But he started in Rome on Saturday and caught the eye with his dribbling skills and direct style of play. The 21-year-old, who is set to leave Borussia Dortmund for Manchester United for 85 million euros ($100 million) after the tournament, could be in line to start again in the semi-final.

Saka shone against the Czech Republic and then kept his place in the starting line-up for the Germany match, only to miss out on the quarterfinal with an injury. Southgate has the luxury of choosing between Foden, Sancho and Saka for a spot on the right wing against Denmark, with Harry Kane, Raheem Sterling and Mason Mount all likely to start.

Rashford, who has scored 12 goals in 45 international appearances, could still have a significant part to play in England's bid to win a first European title, despite playing 57 times for Manchester United in a gruelling season.

(AFP Photo)MELBOURNE: The Australian Grand Prix was called off Tuesday for a second year in succession due to logistical problems caused by the pandemic, but Formula One bosses said they still planned on a 23-race season. The race had been scheduled on November 21, but hit roadblocks over Australia's requirement for overseas arrivals to undergo 14 days of mandatory quarantine. The 2021 Australian MotoGP in October was also cancelled. With Formula One's Brazilian Grand Prix taking place on November 7, drivers and teams would not have been able to complete the required lockdown in time, with suggestions of a more relaxed bio-secure bubble reportedly rejected. The Australian MotoGP scheduled for Phillip Island on October 24 fell for a second year with the Malaysian MotoGP brought forward a week to take its slot and an extra race weekend added in Portugal's Algarve on November 7. Australian Grand Prix Corporation chairman Paul Little said he was ""deeply disappointed"". ""We appreciate the challenge Australia faces with current international travel restrictions and the importance of vaccinations,"" he added. The Formula One race had already been pushed back from its traditional season-opening slot in March to November, sandwiched between the Brazilian Grand Prix and the inaugural race in Saudi Arabia at the beginning of December. Cancellation means two years without a Formula One race at Melbourne's newly-reconfigured Albert Park after the 2020 edition was dramatically called off just before the opening practice session. It follows the cancellation of the Singapore Grand Prix on October 3 also because of Covid-19 worries. Despite the setbacks, Formula One chief Stefano Domenicali said he was confident of still being able to stage a 23-race season in 2021. ""While it is disappointing we won't be racing in Australia this season, we are confident we can deliver a 23-race season in 2021 and we have a number of options to take forward,"" he said. ""We will be working through the details of those options in the coming weeks and will provide further updates once those discussions are concluded."" While Australia has been among the world's most successful countries in containing the coronavirus, seeing just 30,000 virus cases since the pandemic began, it is badly lagging in vaccinations. So far, less than eight percent of its roughly 25 million residents have been fully vaccinated, one of the lowest proportions for any developed nation, with few signs that its borders will reopen any time soon. The decision to cancel could have ramifications for tennis's Australian Open, with the 2022 season's opening Grand Slam tournament due to begin in Melbourne in January. Players were forced to go through quarantine ahead of the tournament this year, but it sparked a flurry of complaints about the conditions and a public backlash. Victoria state Sports Minister Martin Pakula said he was confident it would be a different picture in January with more people in Australia being vaccinated as Pfizer doses become more readily available. ""I'm very confident that the Australian Open will proceed and I'm very confident that next year's Formula One will proceed,"" he said. ""It may not sound like a lot, but the difference between November and January is quite profound.""

From Tuesday's start of the women's quarterfinals until Sunday's men's final, organisers can drop the 50% capacity rule, which has been enforced since the start of the tournament. The cap was part of an agreement to allow fans to attend as the country comes slowly out of the Covid-19 pandemic, which in 2020 caused Wimbledon to be cancelled for the first time since the Second World War.

The host nation will play the winner of Tuesday's other semifinal between Argentina and Colombia in the title decider at the Maracana stadium on Saturday. Brazil have won the Copa America every time they hosted the tournament and in the early part of Monday's match showed exactly why they are favourites to do so again. Within the first 20 minutes Peru goalkeeper Pedro Gallese made two point-blank saves in succession from Neymar and Richarlison plus another two blocks when Casemiro tried his luck from further out. With Paqueta, who scored the winner in their 1-0 quarter-final win over Chile, a standout in midfield, Brazil played some intricate, audacious football, replete with flicks, nutmegs and backheels but it took them 35 minutes to break the deadlock. 🎥🇧🇷 @neymarjr + @LucasPaqueta97: não é replay!

""Shubman Gill has been ruled out of the entire Test series in the UK with shin splints that will take a minimum three months to heal.

In doing so, he also broke MS Dhoni and ViratHowever, despite being aware of the magnitude of Gill's injury, Sharma is believed to have not paid much heed to team management's requests. It now remains to be seen if they put in a formal request for sending Shaw and Paddikal, to BCCI president Sourav Ganguly and secretary Jay Shah. Shah is also the convenor of the senior selection committee. ""The BCCI president hasn't yet received any formal request about sending Shaw and Padikkal to the United Kingdom.

The statement is the first time Prime Minister Narendra Modi's administration has officially said Twitter has lost its immunity after repeatedly criticising the company for non-compliance. The dispute and the public spat has raised concern that American firms will find it difficult to do business amid a more stringent regulatory environment. India's IT ministry told the high court in New Delhi that Twitter's non-compliance amounted to a breach of the provisions of the IT Act, causing the US firm to lose its immunity, according to the filing dated July 5. The filing came in a case filed by a Twitter user who wanted to complain about some allegedly defamatory tweets on the platform, and said the company was not complying with the new law that requires appointment of certain new executives. Twitter declined to comment. The company has previously said it was making all efforts to comply. India's new IT rules which became effective end-May are aimed at regulating content on social media firms and making them more accountable to legal requests for swift removal of posts and sharing details on the originators of messages. Technology minister Ravi Shankar Prasad has slammed Twitter for deliberately defying the law and said all social media firms must abide by the new rules. In recent weeks, as acrimony grew between New Delhi and Twitter, police have filed at least five cases against the company or its officials, including some related to child pornography and a controversial map of India on its career page. Police in two states have named Twitter India chief Manish Maheshwari in complaints. Separately, Uttar Pradesh has challenged in the Supreme Court a bar on police action against Maheshwari, after a lower court protected him against arrest over an accusation that the platform was used to spread hate.

The United Arab Emirates, the group’s fourth-biggest producer, argued against a deal proposed by Saudi Arabia and Russia to extend quota limits until the end of next year, rather than ending them in April as originally planned. The UAE agreed with the other 22 OPEC+ members that monthly output cuts should be eased by 400,000 barrels a day from August, but said the extension should be treated separately. The group normally settles its differences in private and likes to put on a show of unity. But this rift runs so deep that the energy ministers of the UAE and Saudi Arabia aired their grievances in interviews with Bloomberg Television and other media on Sunday. Read AlsoSaudi-UAE tussle could lead to further hike in crude ratesHopes of any respite from rising fuel prices receded on Monday after a bitter dispute between Saudi Arabia and UAE on Monday stalled an Opec-plus output deal, raising the prospect of tighter supplies amid recovering demand and prompting oil prices to jump higher.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies were meant to reconvene on Monday to try to bridge the divide, but called their meeting off. Without a deal, markets will be left in limbo at a time when they’re clamoring for more oil, prices for which are already up around 50% this year. Here’s why the UAE is digging in. Production increaseThe UAE claims it can pump much more than the 3.2 million barrels a day baseline accorded to it under OPEC+’s quota system. Energy Minister Suhail Al-Mazrouei said that level’s “totally unfair and unsustainable.” The country wants an increase to 3.8 million barrels daily if the supply agreement -- signed in April 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic was crushing oil demand -- is extended until the end of 2022. Mazrouei said the UAE has roughly one-third of its output idle, meaning it’s “sacrificing” its production to a greater extent than other OPEC+ members. Saudi Arabia argues that it’s withholding much more oil than the UAE -- and has done for years. Riyadh also insists that the extension is needed to put energy markets at ease because of the continued threat to fuel consumption from the pandemic. Abu Dhabi, which produces almost all the UAE’s crude, is spending around $25 billion a year to help boost its capacity to 5 million barrels a day by the end of the decade. The UAE’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed, sees the plan as crucial for raising more funds to invest in new industries and diversify the economy. “They want a higher baseline to better reflect the investment they’ve made,” Jeff Currie, global head of commodities at Goldman Sachs Group Inc, said in a Bloomberg Television interview. Foreign partnersUnlike Saudi Arabia and most other Gulf OPEC members, Abu Dhabi has international companies as equity investors in its oil and gas fields. Long-standing partners such as BP Plc and TotalEnergies SE, which have operated in the region since before the UAE came into existence 50 years ago, have been joined by others from India and China over the past three years. Sultan Al Jaber, chief executive officer of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co., has led an aggressive restructuring of the state producer since taking on the role in 2016, and has done so with the firm backing of Prince Mohammed. In addition to boosting capacity and ties with Asian energy companies, he’s sold billions-of-dollars-worth of pipeline, refining and real estate assets to foreign private-equity investors. Lower production can potentially hurt those investors as well as the UAE. “We can not continue with our investors losing on their investment,” Al Mazrouei said in an interview with Bloomberg Television. Crude futuresAbu Dhabi allowed its main grade of crude, called Murban, to be traded on a new futures exchange earlier this year. This was a first for an OPEC member. It wants Murban to be adopted by oil traders and other Middle Eastern producers as a benchmark for the region. For that, it needs to ensure large flows to underpin liquidity and trading. Adnoc has said it expects to provide more than 1.1 million barrels a day for the exchange from August. Ramping up Murban production closer to full capacity of about 2 million barrels a day would strengthen Adnoc’s bid for it eventually to get benchmark status.

Given the surplus liquidity in the system, short-term interest rates are very low, and banks offer a risk-free return on idle money. For businesses that have a cash stash running into crores, a 3-4% return (which is what most savings deposits provide), is a decent yield for the short term. The move by the RBI is expected to force businesses to make use of their resources more productively or deploy them in longer-term deposits. The circular had triggered speculation in social media that auto-renewal of fixed deposits would be impacted. However, RBI sources said that the circular does not pertain to auto-renewals at all. Bankers also said that there was no intention to do away with auto-renewals as banks cannot disregard standing instructions given by customers. The RBI is likely to clarify that auto-renewals and renewal of overdue deposits will continue like earlier. In a circular revising its rules for interest on matured fixed deposits, the RBI on Friday said: “If a term deposit (TD) matures and proceeds are unpaid, the amount left unclaimed with the bank shall attract the rate of interest as applicable to a savings account or the contracted rate of interest on the matured TD, whichever is lower”. Earlier banks were forced to provide savings account rates on even bulk deposits which offered returns lower than savings account rates. In the case of overdue deposits, the RBI had left it to banks to their board laying down a transparent policy. This allows the bank to renew a fixed deposit from the maturity date even if the customer delays approaching the bank. The circular could also impact a very small section of retail customers who have accounts in banks that high savings account rates. Several small finance banks and some private banks offer returns ranging from 4% to 7% on savings accounts.

The report has focused on the entire supply chain spectrum, including planning and design, order management, inventory management, procurement and sourcing, aftermarket services, supply chain sustainability and transportation management. EY is No. 1 with over 30 proprietary technology assets. It offers services across consulting, managed services, and technology products. EY has over 47,000 practitioners, nearly 2,000 clients, and 77 delivery centres for its supply chain practice. It has worked with more than 50% of the Fortune 50 and Fortune 100 companies. The report said over 80% of supply chain executives expect third-party services for supply chain to increase, with an expected growth of approximately 5.5% (weighted average) in the next 12 months. Order management, inventory management, and sourcing and procurement are relatively mature. HFS expects significant untapped potential for third-party services in supply chain planning, aftermarket services, and sustainability services. “Over 70% of supply chain executives expect increases in spending on emerging technologies (across cloud, process automation, process intelligence, AI, smart analytics, blockchain, IoT, and 5G) over the next 12 to 18 months. The term ‘supply chain’ is a misnomer for meeting the realities of today's world. It connotes linear and constrained thinking. We need to break free. It’s time to unchain your supply chain,” said Saurabh Gupta, president of HfS Research, who co-authored the report with his colleagues. Accenture, the report said, has built an intelligent supply chain platform that includes over 50 AI apps to deliver applied intelligence micro-services (procurement, intelligent planning, intelligent logistics, intelligent manufacturing) to clients. Accenture has 23,078 people in its supply chain services practice. Accenture made two acquisitions this year -- REPL Group, and GRA -- to strengthen its supply chain business. Infosys has over 25,000 employees in this space. It has 1,300 clients including Mazda, Cisco, Adidas, USG Boral and Syngenta. TCS offers supply chain solutions for retail which include smart sourcing, adaptive forecasting, omnichannel operations, accelerated fulfilment & last mile optimisation, inventory & shrink optimisation. In consumer packaged goods, it offers integrated distributor management & integrated vendor management systems. It has a total headcount of 40,000-45,000 employees with 183 delivery centres.

It also said that in addition, the MD and the CTO of the exchange could be penalised to pay up to 10% of their annual salary in case of such delays or failures. In February this year, Sebi had said it was in the process of forming a comprehensive policy with financial disincentives built in for such failures by exchanges and other financial market intermediaries, comprehensively called market infrastructure institutions (MIIs). The markets regulator has also come out with a detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) for all MIIs. These institutions include exchanges, clearing corporations and depositories. Sebi has put in timelines for corrective actions relating to various types of technical glitches. It also said that any technical glitch leading to trading disruption should be reported to Sebi, a prompt root cause analysis (RCA) carried out and a report submitted to the regulator within 21 days of the incident. In case of failure to adhere to these deadlines, the MII will have to pay a monetary penalty of Rs 1 lakh for each missed day of reporting, which could increase to up to Rs 25 lakh. Sebi also said that in case of “disruption of any one or more of the ‘critical systems’, the MII shall, within 30 minutes of the incident, declare that incident as ‘Disaster’”. If the MII fails to report such a disaster, the institution will pay “10% of average of standalone net profit for previous two financial years or Rs 2 crore, whichever is higher”. It also said that the MD and the CTO of the MII will have to pay a penalty equal to “10% each of their annual pay (both fixed and variable components) for the financial year when the disaster occurred”. To avoid technical glitches, Sebi also said that MIIs should also put in place business continuity plans, disaster recovery policies and system audit processes.

The maximum penalty has been fixed at Rs 10,000 per violation, and the telecom department also created two special wings — digital intelligence unit (DIU) and telecom analytics for fraud management and consumer protection (TAFCOP) — to track crimes committed through telecom networks. The decision to impose financial penalty may act as a strong deterrent against the nagging instances of unwanted calls, messages and frauds perpetrated through mobile networks, which had continued unabated even when subscribers registered for the Do-Not-Disturb (DND) service. To opt out of any promotional SMS henceforth, a mobile phone subscriber will need to send an SMS to 1909 with the message ‘STOP’ followed by the name of the company which has been sending the nagging, unwanted communication. “This will block all the promotional communications from all the headers registered against the said entity, except transactional messages,” the telecom department said. Apart from unregistered telemarketers, the government has prescribed the stringent regime for even the registered marketers who may be crossing their permissible briefs. In case of registered telemarketer, the per violation penalty ranges from Rs 1,000 and goes up to Rs 10,000, with disconnection happening when the unwanted communication goes on for three months in particular cases, or exceeds 50 cases in a month for two months. The digital intelligence unit and the telecom analytics for fraud management and consumer protection wing would co-ordinate with law enforcement agencies, financial institutions and other government agencies in cases involving frauds using telecom resources/ services. They would also identify the connections obtained on fake and false documents, apart from detecting frauds around mobilenumber portability. Importantly, the two units are also tasked with providing facility to the consumers to know the number of connections working against their names and to report about the connections not taken by them. A grievance redressal system, among other things, will provide a platform for the public to register their complaints and monitor its resolution with respect to any Unsolicited Commercial Communication (UCC), the telecom department said.

Nilekani and Sharma had worked together at the Unique Identification Authority of India, when Aadhaar was taking shape. The department for promotion of industry and internal trade, which had begun work on ONDC, had tasked Quality Council of India with the project. Some of the members of the advisory panel had been appointed last year. “ONDC aims at promoting open networks developed on open-sourced methodology, using open specifications and open network protocols independent of any specific platform. ONDC is expected to digitize the entire value chain, standardise operations, promote inclusion of suppliers, derive efficiencies in logistics and enhance value for consumers,” an official statement said. The presence of a few members on the panel has, however, not gone down well with e-commerce players. For instance, QCI chairman Adil Zainulbhai is on the board of Reliance Industries, which is building a large e-commerce empire. Similarly, CAIT secretary-general Praveen Khandelwal is a vocal critic of overseas players such as Amazon and Flipkart. The panel also comprises Anjali Bansal, founder chairperson, Avaana Capital; Arvind Gupta, co-founder of Digital India Foundation; Dilip Asbe, MD, NPCI; Suresh Sethi, MD and CEO, NSDL e-Gov and Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO, Retailers Association of India.

The government added that any non-compliance with “the law of the land” would lead to the US-based platform losing its immunity as a social media intermediary under the IT Act. The immunity is in connection with third-party data hosted on such platforms. In its affidavit, the ministry of electronics and information technology (MEITY) listed the “violations” by Twitter, saying the company had, as of July 1, failed to appoint a chief compliance officer, while the positions of resident grievance officer and of a nodal contact person (even on interim basis) lay vacant. The ministry also underlined that the physical contact address, which was shown to be there on May 29, was not available again on the Twitter website, arguing that all these steps are mandatory under the new rules. It maintained that the three-month period for compliance granted to all significant social media intermediaries (SSMI) under the IT Rules, 2021, including Twitter, ended on May 26 this year, yet the company had “failed to fully comply”. The affidavit has been filed in response to a plea by lawyer Amit Acharya claiming the microblogging platform was not in compliance with the Centre’s new IT Rules. In its affidavit, the ministry said it was informed that Twitter’s grievance officer had quit. But “as per details gleaned from respondent no. 2 website/mobile application, in the interim the grievances from India are being handled by personnel situated in the US, which amounts to non-compliance with the IT Rules, 2021,” it noted. The reply added that the immunity conferred on intermediaries under the law was conditional, subject to the intermediaries satisfying conditions under the act. Failure to observe the IT Rules, 2021 results in such entities losing immunity and becoming liable to face punishment under existing laws, it said.

Andy Jassy, who ran Amazon's cloud-computing business, replaced Bezos, a change the company announced in February. Bezos, Amazon's biggest shareholder with a stake worth about $180 billion, will still hold sway over the company he started out of his Seattle garage in 1995. He takes over the role of executive chair, with plans to focus on new products and initiatives. Jassy takes the helm of a $1.7 trillion company that benefited greatly from the pandemic, more than tripling its profits in the first quarter of 2021 and posting record revenue as customers grew ever more dependent on online shopping. At the same time, Amazon faces activism from a restive workforce just as a rapid economic recovery causes a labour crunch that has retailers, manufacturers and other companies competing for workers with higher wages and other benefits. The company defeated an attempt by workers to unionize at an Alabama warehouse earlier this year, but faces a more formidable challenge as the International Brotherhood of Teamsters launches a broader effort to unionize Amazon workers. In a blog post to employees earlier this year, Bezos said he planned to devote more time to side projects, including his space exploration company Blue Origin, his philanthropic initiatives and overseeing The Washington Post, which he owns. First up, the richest man in the world by Forbes' estimate will fulfill his childhood dream of traveling to space. Bezos, 57, will blast into space on July 20 when Blue Origin makes its first flight with a crew, bringing along his younger brother Mark, an investor and volunteer firefighter. Bezos founded Amazon as an online bookstore and built it into a shopping and entertainment empire that is the second-largest private employer in the US, behind Walmart. Amazon, which is buying the MGM movie studio in its latest major acquisition, now makes movies and sofas, owns a grocery chain and has plans to send satellites into space to beam internet service to Earth. Jassy, who has been with Amazon since 1997, ran the cloud-computing business that powers video-streaming site Netflix and many other companies, making it one of Amazon's most profitable businesses. Among Jassy's challenges are growing calls for tighter regulation on tech giants. A report by the House Judiciary Committee in October called for possibly breaking up Amazon and others, making it harder for them to acquire companies and imposing new rules to safeguard competition.

The grouping abandoned a meeting to bring the two warring heavyweights on the same page without announcing any prospective date. UAE is opposing Saudi proposal to extend the current deal to 2022, with phased increase in production, and demanding a higher baseline for its output quota. Riyadh feels the global economic recovery is still tenuous and wants the deal extended to keep the market in balance. It is also opposing revision of baseline for one member as it will prompt others to demand the same. An immediate fallout is that there will be no increase in August supplies as was expected. This will tighten the market as demand gains traction, especially from the US, Europe, China and India. The market reacted predictably as global benchmark Brent crude rose 1% to near $77/barrel, the highest since 2018. Several investment banks recently projected oil at $80/barrel. This means pump prices will keep on rising unless the Centre reduces taxes it had raised last year. India's crude purchase cost has risen from about $60/barrel in January to almost $75. As a result, petrol is currently selling for Rs 100 a litre and diesel is headed towards a century in most parts of the country, helped largely by last year’s sharp increase in taxes. The Centre had raised excise duty by Rs 13 on petrol and Rs 16 on diesel between March and May last year when oil prices collapsed due to the pandemic. The two hikes raised excise duty by 65% on petrol from Rs 19.98 to Rs 32.98 a litre and 79% on diesel from Rs 15.83 to Rs 28.35. These high taxes are amplifying the impact of rising crude prices, sending petrol price above Rs 100 a litre and diesel above Rs 90 in most parts of the country.

(Representative image)NEW DELHI: The sharp increase in household debts in the pandemic-stricken financial year 2020-21 is a worrying feature indicating rise in debt stress, a report by State Bank of India (SBI) economists said on Monday. Household debt as percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) jumped from 32.5 per cent in FY20 to 37.3 per cent in FY21, mainly on account of the adverse financial impact caused by Covid-19 pandemic. The debt has been calculated after taking into account retail loans, crop loans and business loans from financial institutions like commercial banks, credit societies, non-banking finance companies (NBFCs) and household finance corporations (HFCs), the report said. It also warned that the ratio may rise further this fiscal due to the second wave of the pandemic. Constant rise in household debt levelsThe debt burden on households has been constantly on the rise since FY18. It is to be noted that 2017 was also the year when goods and services tax (GST) regime came into implementation. Since then, the debt levels have increased almost 720 basis points (bps).  !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}(); Falling savings rateRising household debt stress is a clear indication of falling financial savings.

However, the pace of these deposit outflows have moderated now. Between March and December 2020, 599 districts saw an inflow of Rs 11,19,776 crore, while 113 districts saw an outflow of Rs 1,06,798 crore.  !function(){""use strict"";window.addEventListener(""message"",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data[""datawrapper-height""]){var t=document.querySelectorAll(""iframe"");for(var a in e.data[""datawrapper-height""])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data[""datawrapper-height""][a]+""px""}}}))}(); This decline in bank deposits and the increase in health expenditure may result in further increase in household debt to GDP in FY22, the SBI report said.

During the pandemic, the aviation ministry has been regulating both domestic fares and capacity. It has tweaked both as per Covid situation. Now that the second wave is ebbing and daily cases have fallen, the domestic capacity — which was reduced from 80% of pre-Covid to 50% on June 1 — has been increased. The past few days have seen a constant increase in daily domestic flyers, after dipping in April and May. For instance, July 3 saw almost 1.6 lakh domestic flyers — a figure that dipped to less than 50,000 on several days during peak second wave in May. The order issued by ministry joint secretary S K Mishra says 65% capacity is applicable till this month-end. The aviation ministry had last week sought views from airport operators and airlines on raising capacity. Most stakeholders, barring one or two airlines in financially critical condition, had sought being allowed to operate more domestic flights. In a tweet, the ministry said: “Considering increasing demand for domestic air travel, the capacity of domestic civil aviation operations will be increased to 65% from 50% from (Monday) upto July 31, 2021, or until further orders.” Attention Travellers! Considering the increasing passengers' demand for domestic air travel, the capacity of dome… https://t.co/1eAwGsm94X— MoCA_GoI (@MoCA_GoI) 1625496447000A senior airline official said: “The pandemic erupted early year and there is no sign of it going away completely in a hurry. It is best the state, which promises minimum government and maximum governance, leave aviation to market forces. Airlines should be free to deploy capacity as per demand depending on pandemic situation. Fuel prices are on fire and the fare caps also need to go now if airlines have to survive.” The entire travel industry, including airlines and hotels, realise that their survival rests on domestic travellers as international travel could take a long time to open up both ways — Indian tourists being allowed in most countries and foreign tourists being allowed into India. This fact is recognised by government agencies too. For instance, the Airports Economic Regulatory Authority’s consultation paper on Hyderabad Airport (HIAL) tariff says: “The authority has looked into the traffic trends at HIAL and observes that the traffic at Hyderabad Airport is dominated by domestic segment (about 81% of the total traffic over the last five years was domestic passengers). The authority is of the opinion that post-pandemic recovery of traffic at the Hyderabad Airport would be led by domestic segment and that it may recover at a faster growth rate than other major airports which tend to have a higher share of international traffic.” While the norms for international travel will be set by individual countries differently for visitors from other countries depending on the pandemic situation in each place, the travel industry has been seeking uniform norms for domestic travel. Industry leaders say RT-PCR testing requirement should be done away for domestic travel for the fully-vaccinated uniformly across the country. “As of now, there are different rules for travelling from one Indian state to another. This causes confusion among travellers and many therefore decide to defer non-essential travel. There should be one rule — no RT-PCR testing needed if fully vaccinated — for domestic travel. This single step will have a multiplier effect on travel,” said a hotelier.

Yields on most other bonds were largely flat as traders awaited Monday's auction announcement for the week. The Rs 26,000 crore of debt for sale will include Rs 14,000 crore in 10-year paper, although it is not clear whether this will be in the form of a new issue, or a reopening of the most recent one. The benchmark 10-year bond yield closed at 6.09%, its highest since April 20 and up 3 basis points on the day. The most-traded 6.64% 2025 paper ended at 6.73%, down 1 basis point on the day. ""The 10-year bond has become totally illiquid. RBI (Reserve Bank of India) will mostly issue a new 10-year this week,"" a senior trader at a private bank said, adding that the uptick in oil prices had also hurt. Oil prices rose on Monday, driven by a disagreement about output policy that led to a third day of talks to try to break an impasse among producers in the Opec+ group. On Friday, RBI said it would in future sell the benchmark 10-year bond and several other notes using the uniform price-based auction method, in a bid to discourage traders from bidding too far above market yields. Traders said the RBI had also written to primary dealers and the underwriters of the auctions to set out the limits of an acceptable bid and the maximum commission it would pay to the underwriters. So far this year, RBI has either fully or partially cancelled - or underwriters to the auctions have had to buy - Rs 1.16 lakh crore worth of bonds, reflecting the RBI's keenness to keep yields in check. ""The uniform price-based auction will be positive on auction days and will help create better demand in auctions,"" said Harish Agarwal, a fixed income trader at First Rand Bank. After the market close, the RBI said it would buy bonds worth Rs 20,000 crore on July 8 under its government securities acquisition programme 2.0 or its version of the quantitative easing.

Telecom secretary Anshu Prakash told PTI that the DCC (formerly the telecom commission) has also cleared the request for proposal for the rollout of BharatNet project for broadband services in villages in 16 states in public private partnership mode with viability gap funding of Rs 19,041 crore. ""With a view of ease of doing business, the DCC has approved provision of cellular backhaul connectivity via satellite through VSAT for telecom services as per Trai recommendation. ""This will help telecom companies in providing service in far flung areas where it is difficult to lay optical fibre,"" Prakash said. The decision will allow commercial VSAT CUG (closed user group) service providers to provide backhaul connectivity for cellular mobile services through satellite using VSAT to the telecom operators. This will help telecom operators in connecting their mobile towers in tough terrains by using satellite services through VSAT (very-small-aperture terminal) system. The new permission will give an initial edge to Bharti Airtel as the Bharti Group has invested in satellite communications firm OneWeb. The VSAT service providers will also be able to support telecom operators for setting up wi-fi hotspots. Prakash further said within a week of the Cabinet approving public private partnership mode for the rollout of BharatNet in 16 states with viability gap funding of Rs 19,041 crore, the DCC has cleared RFP for the project. ""DoT (department of telecom) will come out with tender for the PPP mode rollout of Bharatnet in 16 states in seven days,"" Prakash said. The Cabinet had last week approved PPP mode to expedite rollout of BharatNet project for broadband services in villages. The 16 states under the scheme are -- Kerala, Karnataka, Rajasthan, Himachal Pradesh, Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam, Meghalaya, Manipur, Mizoram, Tripura, Nagaland and Arunachal Pradesh. The decision to involve private players was taken after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on August 15, 2020 that around 6 lakh villages in the country will be connected with broadband in 1,000 days. According to official data, 1.56 lakh out of the 2.5 lakh village panchayats have been connected with broadband. The government has prepared nine packages for the project by clubbing some of the smaller states. It announced that no single player will get more than four packages.

A five-page form has been sent to employees outlining what all they would be entitled to — including a cash payment of Rs 11,000 to Rs 22,800 to each Jet-1 employee — and they have to vote from Monday (July 5) till August 4, 2021, “for ascertaining the approval or rejection of the consortium’s proposal.” “The consortium’s proposal (for Jet-I employees) is valid only if at least 95% of employees and workmen of Jet-1 vote in favour of it,” it says. The revival plan sees everyone, employees and financial creditors included, taking a huge haircut. For instance, Jet’s financial creditors had raised total claims of Rs 7,808 crore and the consortia has proposed to pay Rs 385 crore to them — 95% less. For employees, the consortia offer includes a welfare trust; 0.5% equity stake in Jet-II that is estimated to have a valuation of Rs 183 crore in fifth year of operation and can be sold to raise funds; cash payment of Rs 11,000-22,800 and a phone/iPad/laptop out of existing IT assets of Jet-1 to each employee of Jet-I. About free tickets, the consortia offer to Jet-I employees includes “credits for future tickets worth Rs 10,000 to each Jet-1 ex-workforce.” While Jet-I employees are not exactly elated with the offer, it remains to be seen how they vote for the plan. “It is a choice between nothing and almost nothing,” said a former Jet pilot who is now employed with another airline. After securing at least 95% employees’ nod for their plan, London-based Kalrock Capital and UAE businessman Murari Lal Jalan will need to infuse Rs 600 crore in the first year. And Rs 175 crore in the second year through ECB, followed by another Rs 600 crore later on. In all, the SRA has “proposed a total cash infusion of Rs 1,375 crore,” says the National Company Law Tribunal’s (NCLT) detailed order for the airline’s revival plan that made available last Wednesday. Settlement of claims from this amount made on Jet-I will be limited to Rs 475 crore. Though raising hope for the airline to fly again, there is as of now not much good news for Jet-I employees. “Corporate Debtor (Jet-I) currently has large number of employees and workmen on its payrolls, who are otherwise not required for the day-to-day affairs hence the resolution professional did not account the salaries and other benefits due to such employees (estimated at about Rs 715 crore as of September 2020) as corporate insolvency resolution process cost,” the order states. The SRA proposes to retain 50 employees and workmen forming part of the asset preservation team.

The initial public offer (IPO) comprises fresh issue of equity shares worth Rs 7,500 crore and an offer-for-sale to the tune of Rs 750 crore by Info Edge (India) Ltd, according to draft red herring prospectus. Zomato, which filed preliminary IPO papers with Sebi in April, obtained its observation on July 2, an update with the regulator showed on Monday.

The online food delivery segment has seen significant growth in the last few years with Zomato and Swiggy competing head-on to grab market share. Zomato's 2019-20 revenue had jumped over two-fold to $394 million (around Rs 2,960 crore) from the previous fiscal year, while its Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) loss was around Rs 2,200 crore. In February, Zomato had raised USD 250 million (over Rs 1,800 crore) in funding from Tiger Global, Kora and others, valuing the online food ordering platform at $5.4 billion. Kotak Mahindra Capital Company, Morgan Stanley India Company Pvt Ltd and Credit Suisse Securities (India) Pvt Ltd are the global coordinators and book running lead managers to the issue. BofA Securities India Ltd and Citigroup Global Markets India Pvt Ltd have been appointed as merchant bankers to the public issue. The shares the company will be listed on BSE and NSE. Last year, Zomato founder and CEO Deepinder Goyal had told employees that the company was planning to go for an IPO in the first half of 2021.

117,timesofindia,Tech,"'Online fun' in India: Sex chats starting at Rs 200 on Instagram, WhatsApp",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/gadgets-news/online-fun-in-india-sex-chats-starting-at-rs-200-on-instagram-whatsapp/articleshow/84166150.cms,"Tue, 06 Jul 2021 12:32:47 IST","'Online fun' in India: Sex chats starting at Rs 200 on Instagram, WhatsAppDebashis Sarkar | TIMESOFINDIA.COM | Updated: Jul 6, 2021, 14:07  IST‘Fun’ gets an entirely different meaning if you go online searching for it. Just do a simple search on Instagram with keywords like “online fun”, “paid fun”, “paid girls”, “online service”, “Paytm fun”, “service girl” and more, the search results will give you an idea about what “fun” means. At a time when the government has clamped down on pornographic websites and is coming down heavily on significant social media platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, Twitter and others to restrict pornographic content, “online fun” is the new undercurrent at play. Here's a reality check about how people are going about porn in India after an official ban. What is online fun?So, what actually happens? If you search for these keywords and contact one of these “online fun” service providers, you can expect a girl to make a video call to you on either WhatsApp or Instagram and strip live in front of the camera, after you have paid her money first. The service and the payment is entirely online. “Paytm, Google Pay, PhonePe kuch bhi kar do…(I accept Paytm, Google Pay, PhonePe or any UPI),” said 22-year-old Priti (pseudo). She was unwilling to talk to a reporter and “waste her time” because time means money to her. But we got lucky as it was a bad day for her with very few “customers” despite charging just Rs 200 for a 15 minute “session”. “Competition bohot zyada hai..Saturday, Sunday ko sahi rehta hai but baki din online customer milna mushkil hai (Competition is tough and it’s difficult to get customers on weekdays),” she cribbed while adding that she charges at least Rs 1,000 for 15 mins to show her face in the video call while stripping. “Log harami hote hai, screen record karke woi video bech dete hai Instagram pe. (There are these wicked ones who screen records the entire video chat and sells it,” she said while rushing to disconnect the under five-minute call with The Times of India--GadgetsNow. Thankfully, Priti was kind enough to share the contact details of another friend named Priya (pseudo) and also warned us about “uncles” posing as girls to cheat money and told us to stay away from people who charges money to share “pictures and videos of girls” over WhatsApp that are otherwise available for free online. Porn banned but what about dating?Dating apps like Tinder, TrulyMadly, OkCupid, etc have a significant number of profiles that offer “online service”. It is so wide-spread that you may come across some genuine profiles created by actual girls who write that they are not into this “online fun” business in their bios. The business model is all about expanding reach and what can be better than grabbing the attention of men on apps like Tinder by posting a random seductive profile photo of some girl and matching with them only to ask Rs 200 or Rs 500 for sharing intimate photos or videos on Instagram or WhatsApp after getting paid via online wallet or UPI. “Koi model ka photo use nahi karte...hum log realistic photos daalte hai on Tinder. (We use photos of real girls),” said Priti’s friend Priya. The deal is to make the dating profile look realistic so that they can finally make some money from their matches. “Ek bar paisa mil gaya, phir kuch bhi share kar do. (Once you get the money, then share whatever you like),” she laughed. She claimed to have several accounts on different dating apps with different photos. And for the “online service” she shares some random videos or photos that she has downloaded online to her customer after receiving the payment. She is even willing to take online payments of Rs 50 on “tough days”. The frauds and ‘demo available’Majority of the genuine “online service” providers are already sex workers. Both Priti and Priya belong to Sonagachi, Asia’s largest red-light district, in Kolkata. Of course, there are others who hail from different corners of India. But another challenge for the “service provider” and the “customer” is the rising amount of fraud incidents. As the money is demanded first, there’s little guarantee that the “customer” would get what he was hoping for. This not only frustrates “customers” but also the “service providers” “Agar customer ka bharosa na rahe phir hum logo ka business kaise chalega. Waise bhi Covid mein sab kuch bandh hai agar online abhi paise ana bandh ho jaye phir hum log kya karenge. (If customers lose trust then this online fun business won’t last. How else should we earn money during Covid, if not from online?), said Priya. She also said that there are a lot of guys who are into this business who simply make money by selling random photos and videos to desperate “customers” looking for a “happy time”. She even admitted that she also does these kinds of “frauds” when she is not in a “mood”. As no “customer” will complain about losing Rs 500 to someone for trying to get an “online fun session”, the “customers” simply leave. In order to tackle this situation, few of the genuine “service providers” have started to post screenshots and blurred screen recordings of their sessions on Instagram as evidence that the deal is real. Some of them have even started to offer “demo calls” to customers for as low as Rs 50 to convince the person that it would be worth paying Rs 500 for a 15 minutes video call. Usually, the trick here is to make Rs 500 every 15 minutes by keeping the “customer” hooked. Selling ‘spycam’ picturesThe entire spectrum of online fun also includes selling photos obtained from spy cams secretly put in public toilets, hotel rooms, changing rooms and other private places. This is the part where “online fun” is no longer funny. In order to make money, people are using platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, Telegram and other apps to sell “exclusive” photos and videos of innocent girls caught on miniaturised spy cams. Depending on the quality of the content, these photos are sold in bulk for prices starting as low as Rs 30 for 10 photos. The prices of videos are usually higher. Instagram blocks porn content, but users find waysWhile Instagram doesn’t allow pornographic content there’s a trick to this business. Only the image of the face of the girl is posted on Instagram and interested users are told to DM (direct message). Then the phone number is exchanged and after the payment is made online, the seller sends the bulk of photos on WhatsApp or Telegram. Of course, content like this can be reported and Instagram does remove profiles providing “online fun” but it is just not enough as all it takes is a new email ID to join back Instagram and continue with business.

The feature allows user to maintain online privacy and prevents third-party marketers to track them all the time. However, a report by The Wall Street Journal suggests that advertisers are now shifting to Android because of this feature. The report cites data from ad analytics firm Tenjin, that has revealed that spending on iOS ad platforms was cut down one-third between June and July. During the same time, advertising on Android platforms has gone up by around 10%. Privacy does come at a ‘cost’ According to the report, ad agency Tinuiti stated that post ATT, advertisers couldn’t bid for targeted advertising on iPhones. Advertisers moved to Android with demand for target advertising on Android jumped up from 46% year-on-year growth in May to 64% in June. The report further said that iOS spending fell from 42% growth in May to 25% in June. Though iOS is still seeing growth, the rate has dropped for iOS in the last couple of months, mainly due to Apple’s push on privacy. During the same time period, Android’s growth rate has gone up. Why ATT hurts and ‘helps’ companies like FacebookATT gives users the option to choose if they want any app to track them. A survey suggested that 91% of iPhone users in the US chose the not tracking option. This hurt companies like Facebook, Instagram whose major revenue stream is tracking IDs of smartphones and delivering ads to them. ""While we expect iOS 14.5 to be a headwind for the remainder of the year, the impact on our business will be manageable,” Facebook said earlier about the ATT feature. However, a report by AppleInsider suggests that Facebook could be benefiting from it as most users in a lot of countries use Android over iOS. The ad rates of Android have gone up and this may be helping many companies, including Facebook.

Similar is the case of the Pokemon trading cards. In such times, Max Hayden, a 16-year old has made a revenue of $1.7million simply by reselling the aforementioned hard-to-get items, the consoles being the PS5 and the Xbox Series X, as reported by The Wall Street Journal. As per the report, the actual profit the youngster made is about $110,000 (still a lot), with the $1.7million being the total amount of sales managed in 18 months. The reason for this profit? Hayden reportedly sold the units at almost double the price of the consoles, which is about $1,100 per gaming console when it costs around $500. Buyers are desperate to get their hands on the next-generation consoles. It seems some can’t wait as it is a long term investment. Hayden, by the way, has been selling other hard-to-get stuff like sneakers too, as per the report. Multiple factors are causing the supply shortage of the gaming consoles like third party sellers, the global chip shortage and the bots that befuddle the online system to make heavy purchases. And it is not looking any better, at least for this year. So, if you are waiting for the consoles to come in stock, it’s best you don’t have high hopes for them reaching the stores anytime soon. Enjoy your PS4s and Xbox One consoles for the time being.

While Samsung may call this variant as the affordable version, don’t expect it to cost drastically less as it may launch somewhere around $1000 and in India, it would be quite surprising if Samsung sells a foldable phone under Rs 80,000. Samsung may not be launching any new Android tablet at the upcoming event, however, the company recently launched the Galaxy Tab S7 FE and Galaxy Tab A7 Lite. Samsung Galaxy Tab S7 FE is available in two models: 4GB and 6GB paired with 64GB and 128GB storage. While the former is priced at Rs 46,999, the latter can be purchased at Rs 50,999.

It is offered in a single 3GB+32GB storage model at Rs 11,999 and Rs 14,999 for the Wi-Fi and LTE versions.

Amazon Business customers who have GSTIN registration for one or few states but want to get their shipments delivered across the country can now conveniently use this feature and manage their indirect office expenses better. Until now, Amazon Business customers were able to get GST invoices only for the orders shipped to a state where they had a GSTIN registration. This caused customer inconvenience as billing address on the invoices were same as shipping address and customers who did not have GSTIN for shipping address could not claim GST Input tax credit for such orders. The ‘Bill to Ship to’ feature aims to address the invoicing concerns of such businesses. As long as customers have one GSTIN in their business account, they will be able to get GST invoice for all their business orders using new address- Invoice billing address which will get shown to them during checkout workflow. Commenting on the launch, Peter George, Director, Amazon Business said, “We understand the importance of GST credit for our customers and are constantly working towards improving their experience on the Amazon Business marketplace. With the launch of the ‘Bill to Ship to’ feature we have taken a lead in solving this unique customer problem and offered a solution which allow them to claim GST credit on their billing address for their pan-India shipments. This convenient feature allows customers to consolidate the tax credit to one state and make use of GST credit more effectively.” DownloadThe Times of India News App for Latest Gadgets News more from times of india newsCoronavirus NewsUS Presidential ElectionUS NewsPakistan NewsDonald TrumpChina NewsSouth Asia NewsWorld NewsNarendra ModiSpotlightHow Amazon India get is supporting small businessesManav Rachna hosts live session with the PMWhat makes IIHM the 1st choice for aspiring studentsHere's why terrace waterproofing is a mustCoronavirus outbreakCovaxin vaccineCowin vaccine registrationCoronavirus live newsCorona cases todayCovshield vaccineSputnik V vaccineTrending NowGoogle Meet FeaturesTwitter Login SecureOppo Reno 6 Pro Launch DateSamsung Galaxy F22Realme X2 Pro Android 11 UpdateMi 11 Lite PricesNokia C20 Plus Go EditionLATEST VIDEOSTop VideosExplained: Why 'bone death' is worrying doctors treating long-Covid patients Mandira Bedi’s first post after husband Raj Kaushal's death Trending VideosJigardan Gadhavi on his bond with Yati Upadhyay: We are in a long-distance relationship Amit Mistry passes away: Malhar Thakar, Naiteek Ravval, and others mourn the loss of the ace actor Janki Bodiwala on COVID-19 pandemic: Wake me up once we are done with this World Siblings Day: Meet the talented siblings of Marathi industry...
